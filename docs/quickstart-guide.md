# Quickstart guide

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    We expect that you're already familiar with the [core concepts](concepts.md) and have followed the [integrations instructions](integrations.md) for your environment.

    This quickstart guide assumes that BunkerWeb is accessible from the Internet and that you have configured at least two domains: one for the web UI and one for your web service.

    **System requirements**

    The minimum recommended specifications for BunkerWeb are a machine with 2 (v)CPUs and 8 GB of RAM. Please note that this should be sufficient for testing environments or setups with very few services.

    For production environments with many services to protect, we recommend at least 4 (v)CPUs and 16 GB of RAM. Resources should be adjusted based on your use case, network traffic, and potential DDoS attacks you may face.

    It is highly recommended to enable global loading of CRS rules (by setting the `USE_MODSECURITY_GLOBAL_CRS` parameter to `yes`) if you are in environments with limited RAM or in production with many services. More details can be found in the [advanced usages](advanced.md#running-many-services-in-production) section of the documentation.

This quickstart guide will help you to quickly install BunkerWeb and secure a web service using the web User Interface.

Protecting existing web applications already accessible with the HTTP(S) protocol is the main goal of BunkerWeb: it will act as a classical [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) with extra security features.

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/tree/v1.6.5-rc4/examples) of the repository to get real-world examples.

## Basic setup

=== "All-in-one"

    To deploy the all-in-one container, run the following command:

    ```shell
    docker run -d \
      --name bunkerweb-aio \
      -v bw-storage:/data \
      -p 80:8080/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/udp \
      bunkerity/bunkerweb-all-in-one:1.6.5-rc4
    ```

    By default, the container exposes:

    * 8080/tcp for HTTP
    * 8443/tcp for HTTPS
    * 8443/udp for QUIC
    * 7000/tcp for the web UI access without BunkerWeb in front (not recommended for production)

    The All-In-One image comes with several built-in services, which can be controlled using environment variables. See the [All-In-One (AIO) Image section](integrations.md#all-in-one-aio-image) of the integrations page for more details.

=== "Linux"

    Use the Easy Install script to set up BunkerWeb on supported Linux distributions. It automatically installs and configures NGINX, adds the BunkerWeb repository, and sets up the required services.

    ```bash
    # Download the script and its checksum
    wget https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/releases/download/v1.6.5-rc4/install-bunkerweb.sh
    wget https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/releases/download/v1.6.5-rc4/install-bunkerweb.sh.sha256

    # Verify the checksum
    sha256sum -c install-bunkerweb.sh.sha256

    # If the check is successful, run the script
    chmod +x install-bunkerweb.sh
    sudo ./install-bunkerweb.sh
    ```

    !!! danger "Security Notice"
        Always verify the script integrity with the provided checksum before executing it.

    For advanced installation methods (package manager, installation types, non-interactive flags, CrowdSec integration, etc.), see the [Linux Integration](integrations.md#linux).

=== "Docker"

    Here is the full docker compose file that you can use; please note that we will later connect the web service to the `bw-services` network:

    ```yaml

=== "Kubernetes"

    The recommended way to install Kubernetes is to use the Helm chart available at `https://repo.bunkerweb.io/charts`:

    ```shell
    helm repo add bunkerweb https://repo.bunkerweb.io/charts
    ```

    You can then use the `bunkerweb` helm chart from that repository:

    ```shell
    helm install mybw bunkerweb/bunkerweb --namespace bunkerweb --create-namespace
    ```

    Once installed, you can get the IP address of the `LoadBalancer` to set up your domains:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n bunkerweb get svc mybw-external -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
    ```

=== "Swarm"

    !!! warning "Deprecated"
        The Swarm integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please consider using the [Kubernetes integration](integrations.md#kubernetes) instead.

        **More information can be found in the [Swarm integration documentation](integrations.md#swarm).**

## Complete the setup wizard

!!! tip "Accessing the setup wizard"

    You can access the setup wizard by browsing the `https://your-fqdn-or-ip-addresss/setup` URI of your server.

### Create an Administrator account

You should see a setup page just like this one:
<figure markdown>
  ![Setup Wizard landing page](assets/img/ui-wizard-step1.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Setup Wizard landing page</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you're on the setup page, you can enter the **administrator username, email, and password** and click on the "Next" button.

### Configure the Reverse Proxy, HTTPS and other advanced settings

=== "Basic setup"

    The next step will ask you to enter the **server name** (domain/FQDN) that the web UI will use.

    You can also choose to enable [Let's Encrypt](features.md#lets-encrypt)

    <figure markdown>
      ![Setup Wizard step 2](assets/img/ui-wizard-step2.png){ align=center }
      <figcaption>Setup Wizard step 2</figcaption>
    </figure>

=== "Advanced setup"

    The next step will ask you to enter the **server name** (domain/FQDN) that the web UI will use.

    You can also choose to enable [Let's Encrypt](features.md#lets-encrypt).

    If you expand the `Advanced settings` section, you can also configure the following options:

    * **Reverse Proxy**: Tweak the Reverse Proxy settings for your administrator interface (e.g., if you want to use a path).
    * [**Real IP**](features.md#real-ip): Configure the Real IP settings to properly identify the client's IP address (e.g., if you are behind a load balancer or a CDN).
    * [**Custom Certificate**](features.md#custom-ssl-certificate): Upload a custom TLS certificate if you don't want to use Let's Encrypt.

      ![Setup Wizard step 2](assets/img/ui-wizard-step2-advanced.png){ align=center }
      <figcaption>Setup Wizard step 2 (advanced)</figcaption>
    </figure>

### PRO activation

If you have a PRO license, you can activate it by entering your license key in the `Upgrade to PRO` section. This will enable the PRO features of BunkerWeb.

<figure markdown>
  ![Setup Wizard PRO step](assets/img/ui-wizard-step3.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Setup Wizard PRO step</figcaption>

### Overview of your settings

The last step will give you an overview of the settings you've entered. You can click on the "Setup" button to complete the setup.

<figure markdown>
  ![Setup Wizard final step](assets/img/ui-wizard-step4.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Setup Wizard final step</figcaption>
</figure>


## Accessing the web interface

You can now access the web interface by browsing to the domain you configured in the previous step and the URI if you changed it (default is `https://your-domain/`).

<figure markdown>
  ![Web interface login page](assets/img/ui-login.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Web interface login page</figcaption>
</figure>

You can now log in with the administrator account you created during the setup wizard.

<figure markdown>
  ![Web interface home](assets/img/ui-home.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Web interface home</figcaption>
</figure>

## Creating a new service

=== "Web UI"

    You can create a new service by navigating to the `Services` section of the web interface and clicking on the `➕ Create new service` button.

    There are multiple ways of creating a service using the web interface:

    * The **Easy mode** will guide you through the process of creating a new service.
    * The **Advanced mode** will allow you to configure the service with more options.
    * The **Raw mode** will allow you to enter the configuration directly like editing the `variables.env` file.

    If you wish to edit the service, you can click on the service name or the `📝 Edit` button.

=== "All-in-one"

    When using the All-in-One image, new services are configured by adding environment variables to the `docker run` command for the `bunkerweb-aio` container. If the container is already running, you must stop and remove it, then re-run it with the updated environment variables.

    Suppose you want to protect an application `myapp` (running in another container and accessible as `http://myapp:8080` from BunkerWeb) and make it available at `www.example.com`. You would add or modify the following environment variables in your `docker run` command:

    ```shell
    # First, stop and remove the existing container if it's running:
    # docker stop bunkerweb-aio
    # docker rm bunkerweb-aio

    # Then, re-run the bunkerweb-aio container with additional/updated environment variables:
    docker run -d \
      --name bunkerweb-aio \
      -v bw-storage:/data \
      -p 80:8080/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/udp \
      # --- Add/modify these environment variables for your new service ---
      -e MULTISITE=yes \
      -e SERVER_NAME="www.example.com" \
      -e "www.example.com_USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes" \
      -e "www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://myapp:8080" \
      -e "www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/" \
      # --- Include any other existing environment variables for UI, Redis, CrowdSec, etc. ---
      bunkerity/bunkerweb-all-in-one:1.6.5-rc4
    ```

    Your application container (`myapp`) and the `bunkerweb-aio` container must be on the same Docker network for BunkerWeb to reach it using the hostname `myapp`.

    **Network Setup Example:**
    ```shell
    # 1. Create a custom Docker network (if you haven't already):
    docker network create my-app-network

    # 2. Run your application container on this network:
    docker run -d --name myapp --network my-app-network your-app-image

    # 3. Add --network my-app-network to the bunkerweb-aio docker run command:
    docker run -d \
      --name bunkerweb-aio \
      --network my-app-network \
      -v bw-storage:/data \
      -p 80:8080/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/tcp \
      -p 443:8443/udp \
    #   ... (all other relevant environment variables as shown in the main example above) ...
      bunkerity/bunkerweb-all-in-one:1.6.5-rc4
    ```

    Make sure to replace `myapp` with the actual name or IP of your application container and `http://myapp:8080` with its correct address and port.

=== "Linux variables.env file"

    We assume that you followed the [Basic setup](#__tabbed_1_2) and that the Linux integration is running on your machine.

    You can create a new service by editing the `variables.env` file located in the `/etc/bunkerweb/` directory.

    ```shell
    nano /etc/bunkerweb/variables.env
    ```

    You can then add the following configuration:

    ```shell
    SERVER_NAME=www.example.com
    MULTISITE=yes
    www.example.com_USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes
    www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/
    www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://myapp:8080
    ```

    You can then reload the `bunkerweb-scheduler` service to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl reload bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

=== "Docker"

    We assume that you followed the [Basic setup](#__tabbed_1_3) and that the Docker integration is running on your machine.

    You must have a network called `bw-services` so that you can connect your existing application and configure BunkerWeb:

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp:
    	  image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello
    	  networks:
    	    - bw-services

    networks:
      bw-services:
        external: true
        name: bw-services
    ```

    After that, you can manually add the service in the docker compose file that you created in the previous step:

    ```yaml
    ...

    services:
      ...
      bw-scheduler:
        ...
        environment:
          ...
          SERVER_NAME: "www.example.com" # When using the Docker integration, you can set the configuration directly in the scheduler, make sure to set the correct domain name
          MULTISITE: "yes" # Enable multisite mode so you can add multiple services
          www.example.com_USE_REVERSE_PROXY: "yes"
          www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_URL: "/"
          www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST: "http://myapp:8080"
          ...
    ```

    You can then restart the `bw-scheduler` service to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    docker compose down bw-scheduler && docker compose up -d bw-scheduler
    ```

=== "Docker autoconf labels"

    We assume that you followed the [Basic setup](#__tabbed_1_4) and that the Docker autoconf integration is running on your machine.

    You must have a network called `bw-services` so that you can connect your existing application and configure BunkerWeb with labels:

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp:
    	  image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello
    	  networks:
    	    - bw-services
    	  labels:
    	    - "bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=www.example.com"
    	    - "bunkerweb.USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes"
    	    - "bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/"
    	    - "bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://myapp:8080"

    networks:
      bw-services:
        external: true
        name: bw-services
    ```

    Doing so will automatically create a new service with the provided labels as configuration.

=== "Kubernetes annotations"

    We assume that you followed the [Basic setup](#__tabbed_1_5) and that the Kubernetes stack is running on your cluster.

    Let's assume that you have a typical Deployment with a Service to access the web application from within the cluster:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: app
      labels:
    	app: app
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
    	matchLabels:
    	  app: app
      template:
    	metadata:
    	  labels:
    		app: app
    	spec:
    	  containers:
    	  - name: app
    		image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello
    		ports:
    		- containerPort: 8080
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: svc-app
    spec:
      selector:
    	app: app
      ports:
    	- protocol: TCP
    	  port: 80
    	  targetPort: 8080
    ```

    Here is the corresponding Ingress definition to serve and protect the web application:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress
      annotations:
        bunkerweb.io/DUMMY_SETTING: "value"
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: www.example.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                  name: svc-app
                  port:
                    number: 80
    ```

=== "Swarm labels"

    !!! warning "Deprecated"
        The Swarm integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please consider using the [Kubernetes integration](integrations.md#kubernetes) instead.

        **More information can be found in the [Swarm integration documentation](integrations.md#swarm).**

    We assume that you followed the [Basic setup](#__tabbed_1_5) and that the Swarm stack is running on your cluster and connected to a network called `bw-services` so that you can connect your existing application and configure BunkerWeb with labels:

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp:
        image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello
        networks:
          - bw-services
        deploy:
          placement:
            constraints:
              - "node.role==worker"
          labels:
          - "bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=www.example.com"
          - "bunkerweb.USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes"
          - "bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/"
          - "bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://myapp:8080"

    networks:
      bw-services:
        external: true
        name: bw-services
    ```
