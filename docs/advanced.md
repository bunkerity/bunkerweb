# Advanced usage

BunkerWeb offers many security features that you can configure with [settings](settings.md). Even if the default values of settings ensure a minimal "security by default", we strongly recommend you tune them. By doing so you will be able to ensure the security level of your choice but also manage false positives.

!!! tip "Other settings"
    This section only focuses on advanced usages, see the [settings section](settings.md) of the documentation to see all the available settings.

## Use cases

!!! tip "Testing"
    To perform quick tests when multisite mode is enabled (and if you don't have the proper DNS entries set up for the domains) you can use curl with the HTTP Host header of your choice :
    ```shell
    curl -H "Host: app1.example.com" http://ip-or-fqdn-of-server
    ```

    If you are using HTTPS, you will need to play with SNI :
    ```shell
    curl -H "Host: app1.example.com" --resolve example.com:443:ip-of-server https://example.com
    ```

### Behind load balancer or reverse proxy

!!! info "Real IP"

    When BunkerWeb is itself behind a load balancer or a reverse proxy, you need to configure it so it can get the real IP address of the clients. **If you don't, the security features will block the IP address of the load balancer or reverse proxy instead of the client's one**.

BunkerWeb actually supports two methods to retrieve the real IP address of the client :

- Using the `PROXY protocol`
- Using a HTTP header like `X-Forwarded-For`

The following settings can be used :

- `USE_REAL_IP` : enable/disable real IP retrieval
- `USE_PROXY_PROTOCOL` : enable/disable PROXY protocol support.
- `REAL_IP_FROM` : list of trusted IP/network address allowed to send us the "real IP"
- `REAL_IP_HEADER` : the HTTP header containing the real IP or special value `proxy_protocol` when using PROXY protocol

You will find more settings about real IP in the [settings section](settings.md#real-ip) of the documentation.

=== "HTTP header"

    We will assume the following regarding the load balancers or reverse proxies (you will need to update the settings depending on your configuration) :

    - They use the `X-Forwarded-For` header to set the real IP
    - They have IPs in the `1.2.3.0/24` and `100.64.0.0/10` networks

    === "Docker"

        When starting the **Scheduler** container, you will need to add the settings :

        ```yaml
        bw-scheduler:
          image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
          ...
          environment:
            USE_REAL_IP: "yes"
            REAL_IP_FROM: "1.2.3.0/24 100.64.0.0/10"
            REAL_IP_HEADER: "X-Forwarded-For"
          ...
        ```

    === "Docker autoconf"

        Before running the [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf) stack, you will need to add the settings for the **Scheduler** container :

        ```yaml
        bw-scheduler:
          image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
          ...
          environment:
            USE_REAL_IP: "yes"
            REAL_IP_FROM: "1.2.3.0/24 100.64.0.0/10"
            REAL_IP_HEADER: "X-Forwarded-For"
          ...
        ```

    === "Swarm"

        !!! warning "Deprecated"
            The Swarm integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please consider using the [Docker autoconf integration](#__tabbed_2_2) instead.

            **More information can be found in the [Swarm integration documentation](integrations.md#swarm).**

        Before running the [Swarm integration](integrations.md#swarm) stack, you will need to add the settings for the **Scheduler** service :

        ```yaml
        bw-scheduler:
          image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
          ...
          environment:
            USE_REAL_IP: "yes"
            REAL_IP_FROM: "1.2.3.0/24 100.64.0.0/10"
            REAL_IP_HEADER: "X-Forwarded-For"
          ...
        ```

    === "Kubernetes"

        You will need to add the settings to the environment variables of the Scheduler container (doing it using the ingress is not supported because you will get into trouble when using things like Let's Encrypt) :

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: bunkerweb-scheduler
        spec:
            ...
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: bunkerweb-scheduler
                  ...
                  env:
                    - name: USE_REAL_IP
                      value: "yes"
                    - name: REAL_IP_FROM
                      value: "1.2.3.0/24 100.64.0.0/10"
                    - name: REAL_IP_HEADER
                      value: "X-Forwarded-For"
        ...
        ```

    === "Linux"

        You will need to add the settings to the `/etc/bunkerweb/variables.env` file :

        ```conf
        ...
        USE_REAL_IP=yes
        REAL_IP_FROM=1.2.3.0/24 100.64.0.0/16
        REAL_IP_HEADER=X-Forwarded-For
        ...
        ```

        Please note that it's recommended to issue a restart instead of reload when configuring settings related to proxy protocols :

        ```shell
        systemctl restart bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
        ```

=== "Proxy protocol"

    !!! warning "Read carefully"

        Only use the PROXY protocol if you are sure that your load balancer or reverse proxy is sending it. **If you enable it and it's not used, you will get errors**.

    We will assume the following regarding the load balancers or reverse proxies (you will need to update the settings depending on your configuration) :

    - They use the `PROXY protocol` v1 or v2 to set the real IP
    - They have IPs in the `1.2.3.0/24` and `100.64.0.0/10` networks

    === "Docker"

        When starting the **Scheduler** container, you will need to add the settings :

        ```

### Protect UDP/TCP applications

!!! example "Experimental feature"

	This feature is not production-ready. Feel free to test it and report us any bug using [issues](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/issues) in the GitHub repository.

BunkerWeb offers the capability to function as a **generic UDP/TCP reverse proxy**, allowing you to protect any network-based applications operating at least on layer 4 of the OSI model. Instead of utilizing the "classical" HTTP module, BunkerWeb leverages the [stream module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) of NGINX.

It's important to note that **not all settings and security features are available when using the stream module**. Additional information on this can be found in the [settings](settings.md) sections of the documentation.

Configuring a basic reverse proxy is quite similar to the HTTP setup, as it involves using the same settings: `USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes` and `REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=myapp:9000`. Even when BunkerWeb is positioned behind a Load Balancer, the settings remain the same (with **PROXY protocol** being the supported option due to evident reasons).

On top of that, the following specific settings are used :

- `SERVER_TYPE=stream` : activate `stream` mode (generic UDP/TCP) instead of `http` one (which is the default)
- `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=4242` : the listening "plain" (without SSL/TLS) port that BunkerWeb will listen on
- `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL=4343` : the listening "ssl/tls" port that BunkerWeb will listen on
- `USE_UDP=no` : listen for and forward UDP packets instead of TCP

For complete list of settings regarding `stream` mode, please refer to the [settings](settings.md) section of the documentation.

!!! tip "multiple listening ports"

    Since the `1.6.0-rc2` version, BunkerWeb supports multiple listening ports for the `stream` mode. You can specify them using the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT` and `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` settings.

    Here is an example :

    ```conf
    ...
    LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=4242
    LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL=4343
    LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_1=4244
    LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL_1=4344
    ...
    ```

=== "Docker"

    When using Docker integration, the easiest way of protecting existing network applications is to add the services in the `bw-services` network :

    ```yaml
    x-bw-api-env: &bw-api-env
      # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for all services
      API_WHITELIST_IP: "127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24"

    services:
      bunkerweb:
        image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:1.6.0-rc2
        ports:
          - "80:8080" # Keep it if you want to use Let's Encrypt automation when using http challenge type
          - "10000:10000" # app1
          - "20000:20000" # app2
        labels:

=== "Docker autoconf"

    Before running the [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf) stack on your machine, you will need to edit the ports :

    ```yaml
    services:
      bunkerweb:
        image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:1.6.0-rc2
        ports:
          - "80:8080" # Keep it if you want to use Let's Encrypt automation when using http challenge type
          - "10000:10000" # app1
          - "20000:20000" # app2
    ...
    ```

    Once the stack is running, you can connect your existing applications to the `bw-services` network and configure BunkerWeb with labels :

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp1:
        image: istio/tcp-echo-server:1.3
        command: [ "9000", "app1" ]

=== "Kubernetes"

    !!! example "Experimental feature"

        At the moment, [Ingresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) does not support the `stream` mode. **What we are doing here is a workaround to make it work.**

        Feel free to test it and report us any bug using [issues](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/issues) in the GitHub repository.

    Before running the [Kubernetes integration](integrations.md#kubernetes) stack on your machine, you will need to open the ports on your load balancer :

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: lb
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
        - name: http # Keep it if you want to use Let's Encrypt automation when using http challenge type
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080
        - name: app1
          port: 10000
          targetPort: 10000
        - name: app2
          port: 20000
          targetPort: 20000
      selector:
        app: bunkerweb
    ```

    Once the stack is running, you can create your ingress resources :

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress
      namespace: services

=== "Linux"

    You will need to add the settings to the `/etc/bunkerweb/variables.env` file :

    ```conf
    ...
    SERVER_NAME=app1.example.com app2.example.com
    MULTISITE=yes
    USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes
    SERVER_TYPE=stream
    app1.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=myapp1.domain.or.ip:9000
    app1.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=10000
    app2.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=myapp2.domain.or.ip:9000
    app2.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=20000
    ...
    ```

    Let's check the status of BunkerWeb :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb
    ```

    Now let's check the status of the Scheduler :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    If they are already running, we can reload them :

    ```shell
    systemctl reload bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    Otherwise, we will need to start them :

    ```shell
    systemctl start bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

### Custom configurations

To customize and add custom configurations to BunkerWeb, you can take advantage of its NGINX foundation. Custom NGINX configurations can be added in different NGINX contexts, including configurations for the ModSecurity Web Application Firewall (WAF), which is a core component of BunkerWeb. More details about ModSecurity configurations can be found [here](security-tuning.md#modsecurity).

Here are the available types of custom configurations:

- **http**: Configurations at the HTTP level of NGINX.
- **server-http**: Configurations at the HTTP/Server level of NGINX.
- **default-server-http**: Configurations at the Server level of NGINX, specifically for the "default server" when the supplied client name doesn't match any server name in `SERVER_NAME`.
- **modsec-crs**: Configurations applied before the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded.
- **modsec**: Configurations applied after the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded, or used when the Core Rule Set is not loaded.
- **stream**: Configurations at the Stream level of NGINX.
- **server-stream**: Configurations at the Stream/Server level of NGINX.

Custom configurations can be applied globally or specifically for a particular server, depending on the applicable context and whether the [multisite mode](concepts.md#multisite-mode) is enabled.

The method for applying custom configurations depends on the integration being used. However, the underlying process involves adding files with the `.conf` suffix to specific folders. To apply a custom configuration for a specific server, the file should be placed in a subfolder named after the primary server name.

Some integrations provide more convenient ways to apply configurations, such as using [Configs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/configs/) in Docker Swarm or [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) in Kubernetes. These options offer simpler approaches for managing and applying configurations.

=== "Docker"

    When using the [Docker integration](integrations.md#docker), you have two choices for the addition of custom configurations :

    - Using specific settings `*_CUSTOM_CONF_*` as environment variables (recommended)
    - Writing .conf files to the volume mounted on /data of the scheduler

    **Using settings**

    The settings to use must follow the pattern `<SITE>_CUSTOM_CONF_<TYPE>_<NAME>` :

    - `<SITE>` : optional primary server name if multisite mode is enabled and the config must be applied to a specific service
    - `<TYPE>` : the type of config, accepted values are `HTTP`, `DEFAULT_SERVER_HTTP`, `SERVER_HTTP`, `MODSEC`, `MODSEC_CRS`, `STREAM` and `SERVER_STREAM`
    - `<NAME>` : the name of config without the .conf suffix

    Here is a dummy example using a docker-compose file :

    ```yaml
    ...
    bw-scheduler:
      image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
      environment:
        - |
          CUSTOM_CONF_SERVER_HTTP_hello-world=
          location /hello {
            default_type 'text/plain';
            content_by_lua_block {
              ngx.say('world')
    	      }
          }
      ...
    ```

    **Using files**

    The first thing to do is to create the folders :

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ./bw-data/configs/server-http
    ```

    You can now write your configurations :

    ```shell
    echo "location /hello {
    	default_type 'text/plain';
    	content_by_lua_block {
    		ngx.say('world')
    	}
    }" > ./bw-data/configs/server-http/hello-world.conf
    ```

    Because the scheduler runs as an unprivileged user with UID and GID 101, you will need to edit the permissions :

    ```shell
    chown -R root:101 bw-data && \
    chmod -R 770 bw-data
    ```

    When starting the scheduler container, you will need to mount the folder on /data :

    ```yaml
    bw-scheduler:
      image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
      volumes:
        - ./bw-data:/data
      ...
    ```

=== "Docker autoconf"

    When using the [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf), you have two choices for adding custom configurations :

    - Using specific settings `*_CUSTOM_CONF_*` as labels (easiest)
    - Writing .conf files to the volume mounted on /data of the scheduler

    **Using labels**

    !!! warning "Limitations using labels"
        When using labels with the Docker autoconf integration, you can only apply custom configurations for the corresponding web service. Applying **http**, **default-server-http**, **stream** or any global configurations (like **server-http** or **server-stream** for all services) is not possible : you will need to mount files for that purpose.

    The labels to use must follow the pattern `bunkerweb.CUSTOM_CONF_<TYPE>_<NAME>` :

    - `<TYPE>` : the type of config, accepted values are `SERVER_HTTP`, `MODSEC`, `MODSEC_CRS` and `SERVER_STREAM`
    - `<NAME>` : the name of config without the .conf suffix

    Here is a dummy example using a docker-compose file :

    ```yaml
    myapp:
      image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello
      labels:
        - |
          bunkerweb.CUSTOM_CONF_SERVER_HTTP_hello-world=
          location /hello {
            default_type 'text/plain';
            content_by_lua_block {
                ngx.say('world')
            }
    	    }
      ...
    ```

    **Using files**

    The first thing to do is to create the folders :

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ./bw-data/configs/server-http
    ```

    You can now write your configurations :

    ```shell
    echo "location /hello {
    	default_type 'text/plain';
    	content_by_lua_block {
    		ngx.say('world')
    	}
    }" > ./bw-data/configs/server-http/hello-world.conf
    ```

    Because the scheduler runs as an unprivileged user with UID and GID 101, you will need to edit the permissions :

    ```shell
    chown -R root:101 bw-data && \
    chmod -R 770 bw-data
    ```

    When starting the scheduler container, you will need to mount the folder on /data :

    ```yaml
    bw-scheduler:
      image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
      volumes:
        - ./bw-data:/data
      ...
    ```

=== "Swarm"

    !!! warning "Deprecated"
        The Swarm integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please consider using the [Docker autoconf integration](#__tabbed_5_2) instead.

        **More information can be found in the [Swarm integration documentation](integrations.md#swarm).**

    When using the [Swarm integration](integrations.md#swarm), custom configurations are managed using [Docker Configs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/configs/).

    To keep it simple, you don't even need to attach the Config to a service : the autoconf service is listening for Config events and will update the custom configurations when needed.

    When creating a Config, you will need to add special labels :

    * **bunkerweb.CONFIG_TYPE** : must be set to a valid custom configuration type (http, server-http, default-server-http, modsec, modsec-crs, stream or server-stream)
    * **bunkerweb.CONFIG_SITE** : set to a server name to apply configuration to that specific server (optional, will be applied globally if unset)

    Here is the example :

    ```shell
    echo "location /hello {
    	default_type 'text/plain';
    	content_by_lua_block {
    		ngx.say('world')
    	}
    }" | docker config create -l bunkerweb.CONFIG_TYPE=server-http my-config -
    ```

    There is no update mechanism : the alternative is to remove an existing config using `docker config rm` and then recreate it.

=== "Kubernetes"

    When using the [Kubernetes integration](integrations.md#kubernetes), custom configurations are managed using [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/).

    To keep it simple, you don't even need to use the ConfigMap with a Pod (e.g. as environment variable or volume) : the autoconf Pod is listening for ConfigMap events and will update the custom configurations when needed.

    When creating a ConfigMap, you will need to add special labels :

    * **bunkerweb.io/CONFIG_TYPE** : must be set to a valid custom configuration type (http, server-http, default-server-http, modsec, modsec-crs, stream or server-stream)
    * **bunkerweb.io/CONFIG_SITE** : set to a server name to apply configuration to that specific server (optional, will be applied globally if unset)

    Here is the example :

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: cfg-bunkerweb-all-server-http
      annotations:
    	bunkerweb.io/CONFIG_TYPE: "server-http"
    data:
      myconf: |
    	location /hello {
    		default_type 'text/plain';
    		content_by_lua_block {
    			ngx.say('world')
    		}
    	}
    ```

=== "Linux"

    When using the [Linux integration](integrations.md#linux), custom configurations must be written to the /etc/bunkerweb/configs folder.

    Here is an example for server-http/hello-world.conf :

    ```conf
    location /hello {
      default_type 'text/plain';
      content_by_lua_block {
        ngx.say('world')
      }
    }
    ```

    Because BunkerWeb runs as an unprivileged user (nginx:nginx), you will need to edit the permissions :

    ```shell
    chown -R root:nginx /etc/bunkerweb/configs && \
    chmod -R 770 /etc/bunkerweb/configs
    ```

    Let's check the status of BunkerWeb :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb
    ```

    Now let's check the status of the Scheduler :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    If they are already running, we can reload them :

    ```shell
    systemctl reload bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    Otherwise, we will need to start them :

    ```shell
    systemctl start bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

### PHP

!!! example "Experimental feature"
	At the moment, PHP support with BunkerWeb is still in beta and we recommend you use a reverse-proxy architecture if you can. By the way, PHP is not supported at all for some integrations like Kubernetes.

BunkerWeb supports PHP using external or remote [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) instances. We will assume that you are already familiar with managing that kind of services.

 The following settings can be used :

- `REMOTE_PHP` : Hostname of the remote PHP-FPM instance.
- `REMOTE_PHP_PATH` : Root folder containing files in the remote PHP-FPM instance.
- `REMOTE_PHP_PORT` : Port of the remote PHP-FPM instance (*default is 9000*).
- `LOCAL_PHP` : Path to the local socket file of PHP-FPM instance.
- `LOCAL_PHP_PATH` : Root folder containing files in the local PHP-FPM instance.

=== "Docker"

    When using the [Docker integration](integrations.md#docker), to support PHP applications, you will need to :

    - Mount your PHP files into the `/var/www/html` folder of BunkerWeb
    - Set up a PHP-FPM container for your application and mount the folder containing PHP files
    - Use the specific settings `REMOTE_PHP` and `REMOTE_PHP_PATH` as environment variables when starting BunkerWeb

    If you enable the [multisite mode](concepts.md#multisite-mode), you will need to create separate directories for each of your applications. Each subdirectory should be named using the first value of `SERVER_NAME`. Here is a dummy example :

    ```
    www
    ├── app1.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    ├── app2.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    └── app3.example.com
        └── index.php

    3 directories, 3 files
    ```

    We will assume that your PHP apps are located into a folder named `www`. Please note that you will need to fix the permissions so BunkerWeb (UID/GID 101) can at least read files and list folders and PHP-FPM (UID/GID 33 if you use the `php:fpm` image) is the owner of the files and folders :

    ```shell
    chown -R 33:101 ./www && \
    find ./www -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \; && \
    find ./www -type d -exec chmod 0750 {} \;
    ```

    You can now run BunkerWeb, configure it for your PHP application and also run the PHP apps :

    ```yaml
    x-bw-api-env: &bw-api-env
      # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for all services
      API_WHITELIST_IP: "127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24"

          SERVER_NAME: "app1.example.com app2.example.com"
          MULTISITE: "yes"
          REMOTE_PHP_PATH: "/app" # Will be applied to all services thanks to the MULTISITE setting

      bw-services:
        name: bw-services
    ```

=== "Docker autoconf"

    !!! info "Multisite mode enabled"
        The [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf) integration implies the use of multisite mode : protecting one PHP application is the same as protecting multiple ones.

    When using the [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf), to support PHP applications, you will need to :

    - Mount your PHP files into the `/var/www/html` folder of BunkerWeb
    - Set up a PHP-FPM containers for your applications and mount the folder containing PHP apps
    - Use the specific settings `REMOTE_PHP` and `REMOTE_PHP_PATH` as labels for your PHP-FPM container

    Since the Docker autoconf implies using the [multisite mode](concepts.md#multisite-mode), you will need to create separate directories for each of your applications. Each subdirectory should be named using the first value of `SERVER_NAME`. Here is a dummy example :

    ```
    www
    ├── app1.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    ├── app2.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    └── app3.example.com
        └── index.php

    3 directories, 3 files
    ```

    Once the folders are created, copy your files and fix the permissions so BunkerWeb (UID/GID 101) can at least read files and list folders and PHP-FPM (UID/GID 33 if you use the `php:fpm` image) is the owner of the files and folders :

    ```shell
    chown -R 33:101 ./www && \
    find ./www -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \; && \
    find ./www -type d -exec chmod 0750 {} \;
    ```

    When you start the BunkerWeb autoconf stack, mount the `www` folder into `/var/www/html` for the **Scheduler** container :

    ```yaml
    x-bw-api-env: &bw-api-env
      # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for all services
      AUTOCONF_MODE: "yes"
      API_WHITELIST_IP: "127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24"

=== "Swarm"

    !!! warning "Deprecated"
        The Swarm integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please consider using the [Docker autoconf integration](#__tabbed_6_2) instead.

        **More information can be found in the [Swarm integration documentation](integrations.md#swarm).**

    !!! info "Multisite mode enabled"
        The [Swarm integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf) integration implies the use of multisite mode : protecting one PHP application is the same as protecting multiple ones.

    !!! info "Shared volume"
        Using PHP with the Docker Swarm integration needs a shared volume between all BunkerWeb and PHP-FPM instances which is not covered in this documentation.

    When using the [Docker autoconf integration](integrations.md#docker-autoconf), to support PHP applications, you will need to :

    - Mount your PHP files into the `/var/www/html` folder of BunkerWeb
    - Set up a PHP-FPM containers for your applications and mount the folder containing PHP apps
    - Use the specific settings `REMOTE_PHP` and `REMOTE_PHP_PATH` as labels for your PHP-FPM container

    Since the Swarm integration implies using the [multisite mode](concepts.md#multisite-mode), you will need to create separate directories for each of your applications. Each subdirectory should be named using the first value of `SERVER_NAME`. Here is a dummy example :

    ```
    www
    ├── app1.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    ├── app2.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    └── app3.example.com
        └── index.php

    3 directories, 3 files
    ```

    As an example, we will consider that you have a shared folder mounted on your worker nodes on the `/shared` endpoint.

    Once the folders are created, copy your files and fix the permissions so BunkerWeb (UID/GID 101) can at least read files and list folders and PHP-FPM (UID/GID 33 if you use the `php:fpm` image) is the owner of the files and folders :

    ```shell
    chown -R 33:101 /shared/www && \
    find /shared/www -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \; && \
    find /shared/www -type d -exec chmod 0750 {} \;
    ```

	  When you start the BunkerWeb stack, mount the `/shared/www` folder into `/var/www/html` for the **Scheduler** container :

    ```yaml
    services:
      bunkerweb:
        image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:1.6.0-rc2
        volumes:
          - /shared/www:/var/www/html
    ...
    ```

    You can now create your PHP-FPM services, mount the correct subfolders and use labels to configure BunkerWeb :

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp1:
          image: php:fpm
          volumes:
            - ./www/app1.example.com:/app
          networks:
            bw-services:

                  - myapp1
          deploy:
            placement:
              constraints:
                - "node.role==worker"
            labels:
              - "bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=app1.example.com"
              - "bunkerweb.REMOTE_PHP=myapp1"
              - "bunkerweb.REMOTE_PHP_PATH=/app"

      myapp2:
          image: php:fpm
          volumes:
            - ./www/app2.example.com:/app
          networks:
            bw-services:
                aliases:
                  - myapp2
          deploy:
            placement:
              constraints:

          deploy:
            placement:
              constraints:
                - "node.role==worker"
            labels:
              - "bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=app3.example.com"
              - "bunkerweb.REMOTE_PHP=myapp3"
              - "bunkerweb.REMOTE_PHP_PATH=/app"

    ```

=== "Kubernetes"

	!!! warning "PHP is not supported for Kubernetes"
		Kubernetes integration allows configuration through [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and the BunkerWeb controller only supports HTTP applications at the moment.

=== "Linux"

    We will assume that you already have the [Linux integration](integrations.md#linux) stack running on your machine.

    By default, BunkerWeb will search for web files inside the `/var/www/html` folder. You can use it to store your PHP applications. Please note that you will need to configure your PHP-FPM service to get or set the user/group of the running processes and the UNIX socket file used to communicate with BunkerWeb.

    First of all, you will need to make sure that your PHP-FPM instance can access the files inside the `/var/www/html` folder and also that BunkerWeb can access the UNIX socket file in order to communicate with PHP-FPM. We recommend to set a different user like `www-data` for the PHP-FPM service and to give the nginx group access to the UNIX socket file. Here is corresponding PHP-FPM configuration :

    ```ini
    ...
    [www]
    user = www-data
    group = www-data
    listen = /run/php/php-fpm.sock
    listen.owner = www-data
    listen.group = nginx
    listen.mode = 0660
    ...
    ```

    Don't forget to restart your PHP-FPM service :

    ```shell
    systemctl restart php-fpm
    ```

    If you enable the [multisite mode](concepts.md#multisite-mode), you will need to create separate directories for each of your applications. Each subdirectory should be named using the first value of `SERVER_NAME`. Here is a dummy example :

    ```
    /var/www/html
    ├── app1.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    ├── app2.example.com
    │   └── index.php
    └── app3.example.com
        └── index.php

    3 directories, 3 files
    ```

    Please note that you will need to fix the permissions so BunkerWeb (group `nginx`) can at least read files and list folders and PHP-FPM (user `www-data` but it might be different depending on your system) is the owner of the files and folders :

    ```shell
    chown -R www-data:nginx /var/www/html && \
    find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \; && \
    find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 0750 {} \;
    ```

    You can now edit the `/etc/bunkerweb/variable.env` file :

    ```conf
    HTTP_PORT=80
    HTTPS_PORT=443
    DNS_RESOLVERS=9.9.9.9 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    API_LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1
    MULTISITE=yes
    SERVER_NAME=app1.example.com app2.example.com app3.example.com
    app1.example.com_LOCAL_PHP=/run/php/php-fpm.sock
    app1.example.com_LOCAL_PHP_PATH=/var/www/html/app1.example.com
    app2.example.com_LOCAL_PHP=/run/php/php-fpm.sock
    app2.example.com_LOCAL_PHP_PATH=/var/www/html/app2.example.com
    app3.example.com_LOCAL_PHP=/run/php/php-fpm.sock
    app3.example.com_LOCAL_PHP_PATH=/var/www/html/app3.example.com
    ```

    Let's check the status of BunkerWeb :

    Let's check the status of BunkerWeb :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb
    ```

    Now let's check the status of the Scheduler :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    If they are already running, we can reload them :

    ```shell
    systemctl reload bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    Otherwise, we will need to start them :

    ```shell
    systemctl start bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

### IPv6

!!! example "Experimental feature"

    This feature is not production-ready. Feel free to test it and report us any bug using [issues](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/issues) in the GitHub repository.

By default, BunkerWeb will only listen on IPv4 addresses and won't use IPv6 for network communications. If you want to enable IPv6 support, you need to set `USE_IPV6=yes`. Please note that IPv6 configuration of your network and environment is out-of-the-scope of this documentation.

=== "Docker / Autoconf / Swarm"

    First of all, you will need to configure your Docker daemon to enable IPv6 support for containers and use ip6tables if needed. Here is sample configuration for your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file :

    ```json
    {
      "experimental": true,
      "ipv6": true,
      "ip6tables": true,
      "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00:dead:beef::/48"
    }
    ```

    You can now restart the Docker service to apply the changes :

    ```shell
    systemctl restart docker
    ```

    Once Docker is setup to support IPv6 you can add the `USE_IPV6` setting and configure the `bw-services` for IPv6 :

    ```yaml
    services:
      bw-scheduler:
        image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:1.6.0-rc2
        environment:
          USE_IPv6: "yes"

    ...

    networks:
      bw-services:
        name: bw-services
        enable_ipv6: true
        ipam:
          config:
            - subnet: fd00:13:37::/48
              gateway: fd00:13:37::1

    ...
    ```

=== "Linux"

    You will need to add the settings to the `/etc/bunkerweb/variables.env` file :

    ```conf
    ...
    USE_IPV6=yes
    ...
    ```

    Let's check the status of BunkerWeb :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb
    ```

    Now let's check the status of the Scheduler :

    ```shell
    systemctl status bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    If they are already running, we can reload them :

    ```shell
    systemctl reload bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

    Otherwise, we will need to start them :

    ```shell
    systemctl start bunkerweb bunkerweb-scheduler
    ```

## Security Mode

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The **Security Mode** setting determines how BunkerWeb handles detected threats. This flexible feature allows you to choose between monitoring or actively blocking suspicious activity, depending on their specific needs.

- **`detect`**: Logs potential threats without blocking access. This mode is useful for identifying and analyzing false positives in a safe, non-disruptive manner.
- **`block`** (default): Actively blocks detected threats while logging incidents to prevent unauthorized access and protect your application.

!!! tip "Detect mode"
    Switching to `detect` mode can help you identify and resolve potential false positives without disrupting legitimate clients. Once these issues are addressed, you can confidently switch back to `block` mode for full protection.


## HTTP protocol

### Deny status code

STREAM support :warning:

The first step in handling denied client access is defining the appropriate action. This can be configured using the `DENY_HTTP_STATUS` setting, which supports the following values:

- **`403`**: Sends a standard "Forbidden" HTTP status code. A web page or custom content will be displayed to the client.
- **`444`**: Silently closes the connection without displaying any web page or custom content.

The default value is `403`. Setting it to `444` is recommended only if you have thoroughly addressed false positives, are experienced with BunkerWeb, and require a higher level of security.

In **stream mode**, this setting is always enforced as `444`, meaning the connection will be closed, regardless of the configured value.

### Default server

STREAM support :warning:

In the HTTP protocol, the `Host` header specifies the server the client intends to contact. However, this header is optional and may be missing or set to an unknown value. This scenario is common, as many bots scan the internet to exploit services or perform fingerprinting.

To block requests with undefined or unknown `Host` values, you can enable the `DISABLE_DEFAULT_SERVER` setting by setting it to `yes` (default: `no`). When enabled, such requests are silently denied by closing the TCP connection using NGINX's special `444` status code, meaning no response is sent to the client.

For stricter security, you can also close SSL/TLS connections when the [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) is undefined or unknown by setting `DISABLE_DEFAULT_SERVER_STRICT_SNI` to `yes` (default: `no`). This approach blocks attackers at the SSL/TLS level. However, it may cause issues if your BunkerWeb instance is behind a reverse proxy that forwards HTTPS requests without SNI.

### Allowed methods

STREAM support :x:

You can define the allowed HTTP methods using the `ALLOWED_METHODS` setting, listing them separated by a `|` (default: `GET|POST|HEAD`). If a client sends a request using a method not listed, they will receive a **405 - Method Not Allowed** response.

!!! abstract "POST Requests"

    If you include `POST` in the allowed methods, you should also include `OPTIONS` to accommodate CORS pre-flight requests.

### Max sizes

STREAM support :x:

The maximum request body size can be controlled using the `MAX_CLIENT_SIZE` setting (default: `10m`). Accepted values follow the syntax described [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/syntax.html).

To allow a request body of unlimited size, you can use the special value `0` (not recommended for security and performance reasons).

### Serve files

STREAM support :x:

To prevent serving files from the `www` folder, set the `SERVE_FILES` option to `no` (default: `yes`). Using `no` is recommended if BunkerWeb is configured as a reverse proxy.

### Headers

STREAM support :x:

Headers play a crucial role in HTTP security. While some headers may be overly verbose, others might require enhanced verbosity to ensure better security, particularly on the client side.

#### Remove headers

STREAM support :x:

You can use the `REMOVE_HEADERS` setting to automatically remove specific verbose headers from HTTP responses. By default, it removes the following headers: `Server`, `Expect-CT`, `X-Powered-By`, `X-AspNet-Version`, `X-AspNetMvc-Version` and `Public-Key-Pins`.

Headers to be removed should be listed and separated by spaces.

#### Keep upstream headers

STREAM support :x:

The `KEEP_UPSTREAM_HEADERS` setting allows you to preserve specific headers from upstream servers, ensuring that BunkerWeb does not override them in HTTP responses.

- By default, it includes the headers: `Content-Security-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `X-Frame-Options`.
- To preserve all headers from the upstream server, use the special value `*`.

Headers to be preserved must be listed and separated by spaces.

#### Cookies

STREAM support :x:

Cookie security is **critical** for protecting user data and ensuring application security. Misconfigured cookies can expose sensitive information, making them a potential target for attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

To strengthen cookie security, you can use the following flags:

- **HttpOnly**: Prevents access to cookies via JavaScript using `document.cookie`, mitigating XSS risks.
- **SameSite**: Restricts cookie sharing policies for requests originating from third-party websites, reducing CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Secure**: Ensures cookies are sent only over secure HTTPS connections, protecting them from being intercepted.

You can configure these flags using the `COOKIE_FLAGS` setting (default: `* HttpOnly SameSite=Lax`). Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/AirisX/nginx_cookie_flag_module) for accepted values.

To further enhance security, the `Secure` flag can be applied automatically for HTTPS requests by enabling the `COOKIE_AUTO_SECURE_FLAG` setting (default: `yes`).

!!! danger "Important"
    Disabling the `COOKIE_AUTO_SECURE_FLAG` setting may expose your cookies to interception over insecure HTTP connections.

#### Security headers

STREAM support :x:

**Security headers are a fundamental aspect of web application security**, helping protect against a wide range of vulnerabilities, including XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks. BunkerWeb simplifies the process by allowing you to configure these headers through its settings. Below is a list of key security headers, along with their corresponding settings and default values:

!!! note "About Security Headers"
    Security headers are a **first line of defense** against malicious actors. Properly configuring them can drastically reduce the attack surface of your application. Use the BunkerWeb settings to fine-tune these headers and ensure your application adheres to the highest security standards.

#### CORS

STREAM support :x:

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) lets you control which origins can access your service and how they can do so.

To enable CORS:
1. Include the `OPTIONS` HTTP method in the `ALLOWED_METHODS` setting to support pre-flight requests.
2. Configure the necessary CORS headers for proper handling of requests.

Here is a list of settings related to CORS:

| Setting                        | Default                                                                              | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                            |

| `CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS`          | `Content-Length,Content-Range`                                                       | multisite | no       | Value of the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header.                                     |

| `CROSS_ORIGIN_EMBEDDER_POLICY` | `require-corp`                                                                       | multisite | no       | Value for the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header.                                     |
| `CROSS_ORIGIN_RESOURCE_POLICY` | `same-site`                                                                          | multisite | no       | Value for the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header.                                     |
| `CORS_MAX_AGE`                 | `86400`                                                                              | multisite | no       | Value of the Access-Control-Max-Age header.                                            |
| `CORS_DENY_REQUEST`            | `yes`                                                                                | multisite | no       | Deny request and don't send it to backend if Origin is not allowed.                    |

Here are examples of possible values for the `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` setting, along with their behavior:

- **`*`**: Allows requests from all origins.
- **`self`**: Automatically allows requests from the same origin as the server_name configured.
- **`^https://www\.example\.com$`**: Allows requests only from `https://www.example.com`.
- **`^https://.+\.example\.com$`**: Allows requests from any subdomain ending with `.example.com`.
- **`^https://(www\.example1\.com|www\.example2\.com)$`**: Allows requests from either `https://www.example1.com` or `https://www.example2.com`.
- **`^https?://www\.example\.com$`**: Allows requests from both `https://www.example.com` and `http://www.example.com`.

### Compression algorithms

STREAM support :x:

BunkerWeb supports three HTTP compression algorithms: **Brotli**, **Gzip**, and **Zstandard**, to optimize performance by reducing the size of HTTP responses. These algorithms help improve load times and reduce bandwidth usage.

#### Brotli

The **Brotli** algorithm provides higher compression rates compared to Gzip, making it ideal for modern web applications.

!!! warning "Compression Levels 20 and above"
    Levels **20 and above**, should be used cautiously as they demand significantly more memory.
    
    Lower levels prioritize faster processing speeds but achieve lower compression ratios, while higher levels focus on maximum compression efficiency at the expense of speed.

#### Choosing the Right Algorithm

- **Brotli**: Best for achieving maximum compression with modern browsers and clients.
- **Gzip**: Provides compatibility with older browsers and environments.
- **Zstandard**: Balances speed and compression, ideal for high-performance use cases.

!!! tip "Optimizing Compression Settings"
    Properly configuring MIME types and compression levels helps balance performance gains with resource usage.

## HTTPS / SSL/TLS

Strong SSL/TLS certificates are **essential** for ensuring secure communication between clients and your server. They protect sensitive data from being intercepted or tampered with and are a fundamental component of a secure HTTPS setup.

Ensuring your SSL/TLS certificates are strong, up-to-date, and properly configured is critical to safeguarding your application and building trust with your users. Combine these settings with a robust HTTPS/SSL/TLS setup for maximum protection.

In addition to configuring HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols, the following settings can be customized to enhance your security:

|            Setting            |      Default      | Description                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS`    |       `no`        | When set to `yes`, will redirect every HTTP request to HTTPS even if BunkerWeb is not configured with HTTPS. |
| `AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS` |       `yes`       | When set to `yes`, will redirect every HTTP request to HTTPS only if BunkerWeb is configured with HTTPS.     |

!!! example "About HTTP3"
    HTTP/3 is the latest iteration of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, designed to enhance web performance and security. Unlike its predecessors, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, which rely on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), HTTP/3 utilizes QUIC—a transport layer protocol developed by Google that operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This shift addresses issues like head-of-line blocking in TCP, leading to faster and more reliable connections.

    NGINX introduced experimental support for QUIC and HTTP/3 starting from version 1.25.0. However, **this support is still in the experimental stage, and caution is advised when deploying it in production environments**. For more details, refer to [NGINX's official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/quic.html).

    Given the experimental nature of HTTP/3 support in NGINX, it may not be suitable for all use cases. Thorough testing is recommended before enabling it in a production setting.

### Let's Encrypt

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

BunkerWeb offers automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation and renewal, making it simple to secure your web applications with HTTPS / SSL/TLS. Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and widely trusted Certificate Authority (CA) that provides SSL/TLS certificates to enable encrypted communication.

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    To use this feature, ensure proper DNS **A records** are set up for each domain, pointing to the public IP(s) where BunkerWeb is accessible.

Below is the list of related settings:

|              Setting               |         Default          | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

|        `AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT`         |           `no`           | When set to `yes`, HTTPS / SSL/TLS will be enabled with automatic certificate generation and renewal from Let's Encrypt.                                                      |
|        `EMAIL_LETS_ENCRYPT`        | `contact@{FIRST_SERVER}` | Email to use when generating certificates. Let's Encrypt will send notifications to that email like certificate expiration.                                                   |
|      `LETS_ENCRYPT_CHALLENGE`      |          `http`          | The challenge type to use for Let's Encrypt (http or dns).                                                                                                                    |
|    `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_PROVIDER`     |                          | The DNS provider to use for DNS challenges.                                                                                                                                   |
|   `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_PROPAGATION`   |        `default`         | The time to wait for DNS propagation in seconds for DNS challenges.                                                                                                           |
| `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_CREDENTIAL_ITEM` |                          | Configuration item that will be added to the credentials.ini file for the DNS provider (e.g. 'cloudflare_api_token 123456') for DNS challenges.                               |
|    `USE_LETS_ENCRYPT_WILDCARD`     |           `no`           | Create wildcard certificates for all domains. This allows a single certificate to secure multiple subdomains. (Only available with DNS challenges)                            |
|     `USE_LETS_ENCRYPT_STAGING`     |           `no`           | Use the staging environment for Let’s Encrypt certificate generation. Useful when you are testing your deployments to avoid being rate limited in the production environment. |
|   `LETS_ENCRYPT_CLEAR_OLD_CERTS`   |           `no`           | Clear old certificates when renewing.                                                                                                                                         |

!!! info "Information and behavior"
    - The `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_CREDENTIAL_ITEM` setting is a multiple setting and can be used to set multiple items for the DNS provider. The items will be saved as a cache file and Certbot will read the credentials from it.

    - If no `LETS_ENCRYPT_DNS_PROPAGATION` setting is set, the provider's default propagation time will be used.

!!! warning "Wildcard certificates"
    Wildcard certificates are only available with DNS challenges. If you want to use them, you will need to set the `USE_LETS_ENCRYPT_WILDCARD` setting to `yes`.

Full Let's Encrypt automation using the `http` challenge is fully working with stream mode as long as you open the `80/tcp` port from the outside. Please note that you will need to use the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting in order to choose your listening SSL/TLS port.

### Custom certificate

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

BunkerWeb also allows you to use your own custom SSL/TLS certificates, providing flexibility for advanced use cases or specific organizational requirements. This feature is ideal for scenarios where you need to use certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed certificates for internal purposes.

Below is the list of related settings to configure your own certificates:

| Setting                | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_CUSTOM_SSL`       | `no`    | multisite | no       | Use custom HTTPS / SSL/TLS certificate.                                          |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_CERT`      |         | multisite | no       | Full path of the certificate or bundle file (must be readable by the scheduler). |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_KEY`       |         | multisite | no       | Full path of the key file (must be readable by the scheduler).                   |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_CERT_DATA` |         | multisite | no       | Certificate data encoded in base64.                                              |
| `CUSTOM_SSL_KEY_DATA`  |         | multisite | no       | Key data encoded in base64.                                                      |

When you enable custom SSL/TLS by setting `USE_CUSTOM_SSL` to `yes`, BunkerWeb will automatically monitor the custom certificate specified in `CUSTOM_SSL_CERT`. It checks for changes daily and reloads NGINX if any modifications are detected, ensuring the latest certificate is always in use.

For stream mode, you must configure the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting to specify the SSL/TLS listening port. This step is essential for proper operation in stream mode.

### Self-signed

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

If you need to quickly test HTTPS / SSL/TLS in a staging or development environment, BunkerWeb can generate self-signed certificates for you. This is a convenient way to enable encryption without requiring an external Certificate Authority (CA).

Below is the list of related settings:

|          Setting           |        Default         | Description                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GENERATE_SELF_SIGNED_SSL` |          `no`          | When set to `yes`, HTTPS / SSL/TLS will be enabled with automatic self-signed certificate generation and renewal from Let's Encrypt. |
|  `SELF_SIGNED_SSL_EXPIRY`  |         `365`          | Number of days for the certificate expiration (**-days** value used with **openssl**).                                               |
|   `SELF_SIGNED_SSL_SUBJ`   | `/CN=www.example.com/` | Certificate subject to use (**-subj** value used with **openssl**).                                                                  |

For stream mode, you must configure the `LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL` setting to specify the SSL/TLS listening port. This step is essential for proper operation in stream mode.

## ModSecurity

STREAM support :x:

[ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org) is a robust web application firewall (WAF) that helps protect your applications from a wide range of attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities. It acts as a shield, inspecting incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic and enforcing security rules to block malicious activity.

In BunkerWeb, ModSecurity is integrated and enabled by default, paired with the **[OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://coreruleset.org)**. The OWASP CRS is a curated set of rules designed to detect and mitigate common web application vulnerabilities, offering strong baseline protection for your applications.

Below is the list of related settings:

| Setting                               | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `USE_MODSECURITY`                     | `yes`          | Enable ModSecurity WAF.                                                                                                                                            |
| `USE_MODSECURITY_CRS`                 | `yes`          | Enable OWASP Core Rule Set.                                                                                                                                        |

!!! warning "ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set"
    **We strongly recommend keeping both ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) enabled** to provide robust protection against common web vulnerabilities. While occasional false positives may occur, they can be resolved with some effort by fine-tuning rules or using predefined exclusions.

    The CRS team actively maintains a list of exclusions for popular applications such as WordPress, Nextcloud, Drupal, and Cpanel, making it easier to integrate without impacting functionality. The security benefits far outweigh the minimal configuration effort required to address false positives.

You can select from the following versions of the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) to suit your application's security needs:

- **`3`**: The stable [v3.3.7](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.3.7) release of the OWASP CRS.
- **`4`**: The stable [v4.10.0](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v4.10.0) release of the OWASP CRS (**default**).
- **`nightly`**: The [nightly build](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/nightly), which is updated daily with the latest rules and improvements.

!!! example "Nightly Build"
    The **nightly build** contains the most up-to-date rules, offering the latest protections against emerging threats. However, since it is updated daily and may include experimental or untested changes, it is recommended to first use the nightly build in a **staging environment** before deploying it in production.

!!! note "Core Rule Set Plugins"
    The OWASP Core Rule Set also supports a range of **plugins** designed to extend its functionality and improve compatibility with specific applications or environments. These plugins can help fine-tune the CRS for use with popular platforms such as WordPress, Nextcloud, and Drupal, or even custom setups. For more information and a list of available plugins, refer to the [OWASP CRS plugin registry](https://github.com/coreruleset/plugin-registry).

### Custom configurations

Tuning ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) can be achieved through [custom configurations](#custom-configurations). These configurations allow you to customize behavior at specific stages of the security rules processing:

- **`modsec-crs`**: Applied **before** the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded.
- **`modsec`**: Applied **after** the OWASP Core Rule Set is loaded. This is also used if the CRS is not loaded at all.
- **`crs-plugins-before`**: Applied **before** the CRS plugins are loaded.
- **`crs-plugins-after`**: Applied **after** the CRS plugins are loaded.

This structure provides flexibility, allowing you to fine-tune ModSecurity and CRS settings to suit your application's specific needs while maintaining a clear configuration flow.

#### Example 1: Adding CRS Exclusions with `modsec-crs`
You can use a custom configuration of type `modsec-crs` to add exclusions for specific use cases, such as enabling predefined exclusions for WordPress:

```conf
SecAction \
 "id:900130,\
  phase:1,\
  nolog,\
  pass,\
  t:none,\
  setvar:tx.crs_exclusions_wordpress=1"
```

In this example:

- The action is executed in **Phase 1** (early in the request lifecycle).
- It enables WordPress-specific CRS exclusions by setting the variable `tx.crs_exclusions_wordpress`.

#### Example 2: Updating CRS Rules with `modsec`
To fine-tune the loaded CRS rules, you can use a custom configuration of type `modsec`. For example, you can remove specific rules or tags for certain request paths:

```conf
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" "id:1,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-xss,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-rce"
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "/wp-admin/options.php" "id:2,ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-xss"
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "^/wp-json/yoast" "id:3,ctl:ruleRemoveById=930120"
```

In this example:

- **Rule 1**: Removes rules tagged as `attack-xss` and `attack-rce` for requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- **Rule 2**: Removes rules tagged as `attack-xss` for requests to `/wp-admin/options.php`.
- **Rule 3**: Removes a specific rule (ID `930120`) for requests matching `/wp-json/yoast`.

#### Key Points
- Use `modsec-crs` for configurations that should be applied **before** CRS rules are loaded, such as enabling exclusions or setting variables.
- Use `modsec` for configurations that modify or extend **loaded CRS rules**, such as removing rules by ID or tag.

This approach provides precise control over the security rules, allowing you to adapt them to your application's specific needs while minimizing false positives.

!!! info "Order of execution"
    The execution order for ModSecurity in BunkerWeb is as follows, ensuring a clear and logical progression of rule application:

    1. **OWASP CRS Configuration**: Base configuration for the OWASP Core Rule Set.
    2. **Custom Plugins Configuration (`crs-plugins-before`)**: Settings specific to plugins, applied before any CRS rules.
    3. **Custom Plugin Rules (Before CRS Rules) (`crs-plugins-before`)**: Custom rules for plugins executed prior to CRS rules.
    4. **Downloaded Plugins Configuration**: Configuration for externally downloaded plugins.
    5. **Downloaded Plugin Rules (Before CRS Rules)**: Rules for downloaded plugins executed before CRS rules.
    6. **Custom CRS Rules (`modsec-crs`)**: User-defined rules applied before loading the CRS rules.
    7. **OWASP CRS Rules**: The core set of security rules provided by OWASP.
    8. **Custom Plugin Rules (After CRS Rules) (`crs-plugins-after`)**: Custom plugin rules executed after CRS rules.
    9. **Downloaded Plugin Rules (After CRS Rules)**: Rules for downloaded plugins executed after CRS rules.
    10. **Custom Rules (`modsec`)**: User-defined rules applied after all CRS and plugin rules.

    **Key Notes**:

    - **Pre-CRS customizations** (`crs-plugins-before`, `modsec-crs`) allow you to define exceptions or preparatory rules before the core CRS rules are loaded.
    - **Post-CRS customizations** (`crs-plugins-after`, `modsec`) are ideal for overriding or extending rules after CRS and plugin rules have been applied.
    - This structure provides maximum flexibility, enabling precise control over rule execution and customization while maintaining a strong security baseline.

<!-- ## CrowdSec

STREAM support :x:

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdsec.svg){ align=center, width="600" }
</figure>

This BunkerWeb plugin acts as a [CrowdSec](https://crowdsec.net/) bouncer. It will deny requests based on the decision of your CrowdSec API. Not only you will benefinit from the crowdsourced blacklist, you can also configure [scenarios](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/concepts#scenarios) to automatically ban IPs based on suspicious behaviors.

### Setup

=== "Docker"
    **Acquisition file**

    You will need to run CrowdSec instance and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. Because BunkerWeb is based on NGINX, you can use the `nginx` value for the `type` parameter in your acquisition file (assuming that BunkerWeb logs are stored "as is" without additional data) :

    ```yaml
    filenames:
       - /var/log/bunkerweb.log
    labels:
        type: nginx
    ```

    **Syslog**

    For container-based integrations, we recommend you to redirect the logs of the BunkerWeb container to a syslog service that will store the logs so CrowdSec can access it easily. Here is an example configuration for syslog-ng that will store raw logs coming from BunkerWeb to a local `/var/log/bunkerweb.log` file :

    ```syslog
    @version: 4.7

    source s_net {
        udp(
            ip("0.0.0.0")
        );
    };

    template t_imp {
        template("$MSG\n");
        template_escape(no);
    };

    destination d_file {
        file("/var/log/bunkerweb.log" template(t_imp));
    };

    log {
        source(s_net);
        destination(d_file);
    };
    ```

    **Optional : Application Security Component**

    CrowdSec also provides an [Application Security Component](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/appsec/intro) that can be used to protect your application from attacks. You can configure the plugin to send requests to the AppSec Component for further analysis. If you want to use it, you will need to create another acquisition file for the AppSec Component :

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
        type: appsec
    listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    **Docker Compose**

    Here is the docker-compose boilerplate that you can use (**don't forget to edit the bouncer key**) :

    ```yaml
    services:
        bunkerweb:

=== "Linux"

    You'll need to install CrowdSec and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. To do so, you can follow the [official documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec).

    For CrowdSec to parse BunkerWeb logs, you have to add the following lines to your acquisition file located in `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml` :

    ```yaml
    filenames:
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/access.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/error.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/modsec_audit.log
    labels:
        type: nginx
    ```

    Now we have to add our custom bouncer to the CrowdSec API. To do so, you can use the `cscli` tool :

    ```shell
    sudo cscli bouncers add crowdsec-bunkerweb-bouncer/v1.6
    ```

    !!! warning "API key"
        Keep the key generated by the `cscli` command, you will need it later.

    Now restart the CrowdSec service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    **Optional : Application Security Component with Linux**

    If you want to use the AppSec Component, you will need to create another acquisition file for it located in `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml` :

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
        type: appsec
    listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    And you will need to install the AppSec Component's collections :

    ```shell
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules
    ```

    Now you just have to restart the CrowdSec service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    If you need more information about the AppSec Component, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/appsec/intro).

    **Settings**

    Now you can configure the plugin by adding the following settings to your BunkerWeb configuration file :

    ```env
    USE_CROWDSEC=yes
    CROWDSEC_API=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    CROWDSEC_API_KEY=<The key provided by cscli>
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422 # Comment if you don't want to use the AppSec Component
    ```

    And finally reload the BunkerWeb service :

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl reload bunkerweb
    ``` -->

## Bad behavior

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

Attackers often generate "suspicious" HTTP status codes when probing for or exploiting vulnerabilities—codes that a typical user is unlikely to trigger within a given time frame. By detecting this behavior, BunkerWeb can automatically ban the offending IP address, forcing the attacker to switch to a new IP to continue their attempts.

This security measure, known as **"Bad Behavior,"** is implemented and enabled by default in BunkerWeb, providing an additional layer of protection against malicious activity.

Below is the list of related settings:

|           Setting           |            Default            | Description                                                                  |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR`      |             `yes`             | When set to `yes`, the Bad behavior feature will be enabled.                 |
| `BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES` | `400 401 403 404 405 429 444` | List of HTTP status codes considered as "suspicious".                        |
|  `BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD`   |             `10`              | Maximum number of "suspicious" HTTP status codes within the time period.     |
|  `BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME`  |             `60`              | Period of time during which we count "suspicious" HTTP status codes.         |
|   `BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME`   |            `86400`            | The duration time (in seconds) of a ban when a client reached the threshold. |

By default, BunkerWeb's **"Bad Behavior"** feature works as follows:

- If a client generates more than **10** HTTP status codes from the list `400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 429, 444` within a **60-second** period, their IP address will be banned for **86400 seconds** (24 hours).

In **stream mode**, only the `444` status code is considered "bad" and will trigger this behavior.

This configuration helps prevent attackers from repeatedly probing your server for vulnerabilities while minimizing the impact on legitimate users.

## Antibot

STREAM support :x:

Attackers often use automated tools to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. A common countermeasure is to challenge users to determine whether they are bots. If the challenge is successfully completed, the client is deemed "legitimate" and granted access to the web application.

BunkerWeb includes a built-in "Antibot" feature to implement this type of security, though it is not enabled by default. Below are the supported challenge mechanisms:

- **Cookie**: Sends a cookie to the client and expects it to be returned on subsequent requests.
- **JavaScript**: Requires the client to solve a computational challenge using JavaScript.
- **Captcha**: Presents a traditional CAPTCHA challenge (no external dependencies).
- **hCaptcha**: Challenges the client with a CAPTCHA provided by hCaptcha.
- **reCAPTCHA**: Uses Google reCAPTCHA to ensure the client achieves a minimum score.
- **Turnstile**: Enforces rate limiting and access control using Cloudflare Turnstile, leveraging various mechanisms.

Here is the list of related settings :

| Setting                     | Default      | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                                    |

| `ANTIBOT_TIME_RESOLVE`      | `60`         | multisite | no       | Maximum time (in seconds) clients have to resolve the challenge. Once this time has passed, a new challenge will be generated. |
| `ANTIBOT_TIME_VALID`        | `86400`      | multisite | no       | Maximum validity time of solved challenges. Once this time has passed, clients will need to resolve a new one.                 |
| `ANTIBOT_RECAPTCHA_SCORE`   | `0.7`        | multisite | no       | Minimum score required for reCAPTCHA challenge (Only compatible with reCAPTCHA v3).                                            |
| `ANTIBOT_RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY` |              | multisite | no       | Sitekey for reCAPTCHA challenge.                                                                                               |

Please note that antibot feature is using a cookie to maintain a session with clients. If you are using BunkerWeb in a clustered environment, you will need to set the `SESSIONS_SECRET` and `SESSIONS_NAME` settings to another value than the default one (which is `random`). You will find more info about sessions [here](settings.md#sessions).

## Blacklisting, whitelisting and greylisting

The security features for blacklisting, whitelisting, and greylisting are straightforward to understand:

- **Blacklisting**: If a specific criterion is met, the client will be blocked.
- **Whitelisting**: If a specific criterion is met, the client will be allowed, bypassing all additional security checks.
- **Greylisting**: If a specific criterion is met, the client will be allowed but subjected to additional security checks else the client will be blocked.

These mechanisms can be configured simultaneously. If all three are enabled and a client meets criteria for multiple lists, **whitelisting takes precedence**, followed by blacklisting, and finally greylisting. In such cases, a whitelisted client will bypass both blacklisting and greylisting, regardless of overlapping criteria.

### Blacklisting

!!! info "stream mode"
    When using stream mode, only IP, RDNS and ASN checks will be done.

!!! tip "Ignore lists"
    The ignore lists are useful when you want to block a specific criterion but want to exclude some IPs, RDNS, ASN, User-Agent, or URI from the blacklist.

!!! info "stream mode"
    When using stream mode, only IP, RDNS and ASN checks will be done.

## Reverse scan

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The reverse scan feature is designed to identify open ports by attempting to establish TCP connections with clients' IP addresses. This is particularly useful for detecting potential open proxies or connections originating from servers.

By default, we provide a list of suspicious ports, which you can customize to suit your specific needs. However, keep in mind that adding too many ports to the list may slow down client connections due to the additional network checks. If an open port from the list is detected, the client's access will be denied.

Here is the list of settings related to reverse scan :

|        Setting         |          Default           | Description                                               |
| :--------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `USE_REVERSE_SCAN`   |            `no`            | When set to `yes`, will enable ReverseScan.               |
|  `REVERSE_SCAN_PORTS`  | `22 80 443 3128 8000 8080` | List of suspicious ports to scan.                         |
| `REVERSE_SCAN_TIMEOUT` |           `500`            | Specify the maximum timeout (in ms) when scanning a port. |

## BunkerNet

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

**BunkerNet** is a global, crowdsourced database of malicious requests, collaboratively shared among all BunkerWeb instances worldwide.

When you enable BunkerNet, malicious requests detected by your instance are sent to a remote server, where they are analyzed by our advanced systems. This process allows us to aggregate and extract malicious patterns from reports across all participating instances. The resulting insights are then redistributed to bolster the security of every BunkerWeb instance connected to BunkerNet.

Beyond the enhanced security that comes from leveraging this collective intelligence, enabling BunkerNet unlocks additional features, such as seamless integration with the **CrowdSec Console**, providing further tools to monitor and manage threats effectively.

The setting used to enable or disable BunkerNet is `USE_BUNKERNET` (default : `yes`).

### CrowdSec Console integration

If you're not already familiar with it, [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/?utm_campaign=bunkerweb&utm_source=doc) is an open-source cybersecurity solution that leverages crowdsourced intelligence to combat cyber threats. Think of it as the "Waze of cybersecurity"—when one server is attacked, other systems worldwide are alerted and protected from the same attackers. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.crowdsec.net/about?utm_campaign=bunkerweb&utm_source=blog).

Through our partnership with CrowdSec, you can enroll your BunkerWeb instances into your [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup?utm_source=external-blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-integration). This means that attacks blocked by BunkerWeb will be visible in your CrowdSec Console alongside attacks blocked by CrowdSec Security Engines, giving you a unified view of threats.

Importantly, CrowdSec does not need to be installed for this integration (though we highly recommend trying it out with the [CrowdSec plugin for BunkerWeb](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb-plugins/tree/main/crowdsec) to further enhance the security of your web services). Additionally, you can enroll your CrowdSec Security Engines into the same Console account for even greater synergy.

**Step #1 : create your CrowdSec Console account**

Go to the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup?utm_source=external-blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-integration) and register your account if you don't already have one. Once it's done, write down your enroll key by going to "Security Engines", then "Engines" and click on "Add Security Engine" :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity1.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Get your Crowdsec Console enroll key</figcaption>
</figure>

**Step #2 : get your BunkerNet ID**

Activating the BunkerNet feature (which is the case by default) is mandatory if you want to enroll your BunkerWeb instance(s) into your CrowdSec console. You can do it by setting `USE_BUNKERNET` to `yes`.

Get your BunkerNet ID on Docker :

```shell
docker exec my-bw-scheduler cat /var/cache/bunkerweb/bunkernet/instance.id
```

Get your BunkerNet ID on Linux :

```shell
cat /var/cache/bunkerweb/bunkernet/instance.id
```

**Step #3 : enroll your instance using the Panel**

Once you have noted your BunkerNet ID and CrowdSec Console enroll key, you can [order the free product "BunkerNet / CrowdSec" on the Panel](https://panel.bunkerweb.io/order/bunkernet/11?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=doc). Please note that you will need to create an account if you don't already have one.

You can now select the "BunkerNet / CrowdSec" service and fill out the form by pasting your BunkerNet ID and CrowdSec Console enroll key :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity2.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Enroll your BunkerWeb instance into the CrowdSec Console</figcaption>
</figure>

**Step #4 : accept new security engine on the Console**

Last but not least, you need to go back to your CrowdSec Console and accept the new Security Engine :

<figure markdown>
  ![Overview](assets/img/crowdity3.png){ align=center }
  <figcaption>Accept enroll into the CrowdSec Console</figcaption>
</figure>

**Congratulations, your BunkerWeb instance is now enrolled into your CrowdSec Console !**

Pro tip : when viewing your alerts, click on "columns" and tick the "context" checkbox to get access to BunkerWeb specific data.

## DNSBL

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

**DNSBL** (Domain Name System Blacklist) is an external database of malicious IP addresses that can be queried using the DNS protocol. BunkerWeb supports automatic querying of such blacklists, providing an additional layer of security.

When a client connects, BunkerWeb can query the DNSBL server of your choice. If the server confirms that the client's IP address is listed as malicious, BunkerWeb will automatically ban the client, preventing any potential threats from reaching your application. This streamlined integration enhances your ability to block known malicious actors in real time.

Here is the list of settings related to DNSBL :

|   Setting    |                       Default                       | Description                                    |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_DNSBL`  |                        `yes`                        | When set to `yes`, will enable DNSBL checking. |
| `DNSBL_LIST` | `bl.blocklist.de sbl.spamhaus.org xbl.spamhaus.org` | List of DNSBL servers to ask.                  |

## Limiting

BunkerWeb allows you to enforce limit policies on the following:

- **Number of connections per IP**
- **Number of requests per IP and URL within a specific time period**

While these policies are not designed to effectively mitigate DoS or DDoS attacks, they serve as powerful tools for preventing brute-force attempts or implementing rate limiting for APIs.

In both cases—whether the limit applies to connections or requests—clients exceeding the defined limits will receive an HTTP status code **"429 - Too Many Requests"**, ensuring fair usage and protecting your resources.

### Connections

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The following settings are related to the Limiting connections feature :

|         Setting         | Default | Description                                                                                |
| :---------------------: | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `USE_LIMIT_CONN`     |  `yes`  | When set to `yes`, will limit the maximum number of concurrent connections for a given IP. |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_HTTP1`  |  `10`   | Maximum number of concurrent connections when using HTTP1 protocol.                        |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_HTTP2`  |  `100`  | Maximum number of concurrent streams when using HTTP2 protocol.                            |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_HTTP3`  |  `100`  | Maximum number of concurrent streams when using HTTP3 protocol.                            |
| `LIMIT_CONN_MAX_STREAM` |  `10`   | Maximum number of connections per IP when using stream.                                    |

### Requests

STREAM support :x:

The following settings are related to the Limiting requests feature :

| Setting          | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_LIMIT_REQ`  | `yes`   | multisite | no       | Activate limit requests feature.                                                              |
| `LIMIT_REQ_URL`  | `/`     | multisite | yes      | URL (PCRE regex) where the limit request will be applied or special value / for all requests. |
| `LIMIT_REQ_RATE` | `2r/s`  | multisite | yes      | Rate to apply to the URL (s for second, m for minute, h for hour and d for day).              |

You can configure specific rate limits for different URLs by appending a numeric suffix to the relevant settings, providing fine-grained control over traffic to various endpoints. For example:

- **`LIMIT_REQ_URL_1=^/url1$`** and **`LIMIT_REQ_RATE_1=5r/d`**: Limits requests to `/url1` to a maximum of 5 requests per day.
- **`LIMIT_REQ_URL_2=^/url2/subdir/.*$`** and **`LIMIT_REQ_RATE_2=1r/m`**: Imposes a stricter limit of 1 request per minute for any URL under `/url2/subdir/`.

This flexibility ensures tailored rate limits for different endpoints based on their usage patterns, sensitivity, or importance.

!!! tip "Rate Limiting Best Practices"
    - **Regex Matching**:
      The `LIMIT_REQ_URL` values use **PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)**, allowing advanced patterns to precisely match specific URLs or structures. This supports complex scenarios such as:
        - Matching nested paths.
        - Limiting requests to specific file types (e.g., `^/files/.*\.pdf$`).
        - Handling parameterized URLs.

    - **Efficient Traffic Management**:
      Properly applied, these settings help balance resource usage, mitigate abuse, and protect critical endpoints without impacting legitimate users.

## Country

STREAM support :white_check_mark:

The **Country Security** feature enables you to enforce policies based on the geographic location of a client's IP address. This provides an additional layer of control and security for your application. You can configure it to:

- **Blacklist**: Deny access to clients if their country is included in a blacklist. These clients will be entirely blocked from reaching your application.
- **Whitelist**: Allow access only to clients whose country is included in a whitelist. Clients from other countries will be denied access, but those allowed will still undergo other configured security checks.

This feature is particularly useful for restricting access to certain regions, protecting sensitive resources, or reducing exposure to potential threats originating from specific areas.

Here is the list of related settings :

| Setting             | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BLACKLIST_COUNTRY` |         | multisite | no       | Deny access if the country of the client is in the list (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format separated with spaces).     |
| `WHITELIST_COUNTRY` |         | multisite | no       | Deny access if the country of the client is not in the list (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format separated with spaces). |

Using both a country blacklist and a whitelist simultaneously is logically redundant and not recommended. If both are configured, the **whitelist takes precedence**, meaning only the whitelist will be applied, and the blacklist will be ignored.

To avoid confusion and ensure clear policy enforcement, use either a blacklist or a whitelist based on your specific security requirements, but not both at the same time.

## Authentication

### Auth basic

STREAM support :x:

To safeguard sensitive resources, such as an admin area, you can enable **HTTP Basic Authentication**. This simple yet effective mechanism requires users to provide valid credentials before accessing the protected resource, adding an extra layer of security with minimal configuration.

Here is the list of related settings :

|        Setting        |      Default      | Multiple                            | Description                                                                                  |
| :-------------------: | :---------------: | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `USE_AUTH_BASIC`    |       `no`        | no                                  | When set to `yes` HTTP auth basic will be enabled.                                           |
| `AUTH_BASIC_LOCATION` |    `sitewide`     | no                                  | Location (URL) of the sensitive resource. Use special value `sitewide` to enable everywhere. |
|   `AUTH_BASIC_USER`   |    `changeme`     | yes                                 | The username required.                                                                       |
| `AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD` |    `changeme`     | yes                                 | The password required.                                                                       |
|   `AUTH_BASIC_TEXT`   | `Restricted area` | Text to display in the auth prompt. |

!!! tip "multi users"
    You can set multiple users by using the following format : `AUTH_BASIC_USER_1`, `AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD_1`, `AUTH_BASIC_USER_2`, `AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD_2`, etc.

### Auth request

For more advanced authentication methods, such as Single Sign-On (SSO), you can leverage the **auth request settings**. This allows integration with external authentication systems by using subrequest-based authentication. For detailed information about this feature, refer to the [NGINX documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/).

To help you get started, the [BunkerWeb repository](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/tree/v1.6.0-rc2/examples) includes examples for popular authentication solutions like [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) and [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/). These examples demonstrate how to integrate these tools seamlessly with your deployment.

**Auth request settings are related to reverse proxy rules.**

| Setting                                 | Default | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST`            |         | multisite | yes      | Enable authentication using an external provider (value of auth_request directive).                                  |
| `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST_SIGNIN_URL` |         | multisite | yes      | Redirect clients to sign-in URL when using REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST (used when auth_request call returned 401).    |
| `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH_REQUEST_SET`        |         | multisite | yes      | List of variables to set from the authentication provider, separated with ; (values of auth_request_set directives). |

Data is invaluable, especially in digital environments where it's susceptible to loss due to various factors such as hardware failures, software errors, or human mistakes. To mitigate such risks and ensure the safety and availability of your important files, it's crucial to establish a robust backup system. This section outlines the backup functionality provided by BunkerWeb, allowing you to securely store your data in a custom location through regular backups.

!!! info "Information and behavior"

    The importance of backups cannot be overstated. They serve as a safety net against data loss scenarios, providing a means to restore your system to a previous state in case of unexpected events. Regular backups not only safeguard your data but also offer peace of mind, knowing that you have a reliable mechanism in place to recover from any mishaps.

| `BACKUP_SCHEDULE`  | `daily`                      | global  | no       | The frequency of the backup                   |
| `BACKUP_ROTATION`  | `7`                          | global  | no       | The number of backups to keep                 |
| `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` | `/var/lib/bunkerweb/backups` | global  | no       | The directory where the backup will be stored |

#### Manual backup

To manually initiate a backup, execute the following command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

This command will create a backup of your database and store it in the backup directory specified in the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting.

You can also specify a custom directory for the backup by providing the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` environment variable when executing the command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/path/to/backup/directory bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it -e BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/path/to/backup/directory <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup save
    ```

    ```bash
    docker cp <scheduler_container>:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/backup/directory
    ```

!!! note "Specifications for MariaDB/MySQL"

    In case you are using MariaDB/MySQL, you may encounter the following error when trying to backup your database:

    ```bash
    caching_sha2_password could not be loaded: Error loading shared library /usr/lib/mariadb/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so
    ```

    To resolve this issue, you can execute the following command to change the authentication plugin to `mysql_native_password`:

    ```sql
    ALTER USER 'yourusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'youpassword';
    ```

    If you're using the Docker integration, you can add the following command to the `docker-compose.yml` file to automatically change the authentication plugin:

    === "MariaDB"

        ```yaml
        bw-db:
            image: mariadb:<version>
            command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
            ...
        ```

    === "MySQL"

        ```yaml
        bw-db:
            image: mysql:<version>
            command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
            ...
        ```

#### Manual restore

To manually initiate a restore, execute the following command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup restore
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup restore
    ```

This command will create a temporary backup of your database in `/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups` and restore your database to the latest backup available in the backup directory specified in the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting.

You can also specify a custom backup file for the restore by providing the path to it as an argument when executing the command:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    bwcli plugin backup restore /path/to/backup/file
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker cp /path/to/backup/file <scheduler_container>:/path/to/backup/file
    ```

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <scheduler_container> bwcli plugin backup restore /path/to/backup/file
    ```

!!! example "In case of failure"

    Don't worry if the restore fails, you can always restore your database to the previous state by executing the command again but with the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting set to `/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups`:

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups bwcli plugin backup restore
        ```

    === "Docker"

        ```bash
        docker cp <scheduler_container>:/var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups /var/tmp/bunkerweb/backups
        ```

        ```bash
