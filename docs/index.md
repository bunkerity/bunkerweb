BunkerWeb is a next-generation, open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF).

As a full-featured web server (based on [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) under the hood), it protects your web services to make them "secure by default." BunkerWeb integrates seamlessly into your existing environments ([Linux](integrations.md#linux), [Docker](integrations.md#docker), [Swarm](integrations.md#swarm), [Kubernetes](integrations.md#kubernetes), â€¦) as a reverse proxy and is fully configurable (don't panic, there is an [awesome web UI](web-ui.md) if you don't like the CLI) to meet your specific use cases. In other words, cybersecurity is no longer a hassle.

BunkerWeb includes primary [security features](advanced.md#security-tuning) as part of the core but can be easily extended with additional ones thanks to a [plugin system](plugins.md).
