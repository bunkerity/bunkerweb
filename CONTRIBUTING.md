## Reporting bugs / ask for features

The preferred way to report bugs and asking for features is using [issues](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/issues). Before opening a new one, please check if a related issue is already opened using the "filters" bar. When creating a new issue please select and fill the "Bug report" or "Feature request" template.

## Code contribution

The preferred way to contribute code is using [pull requests](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/pulls). Before creating a pull request, please check if your code is related to an opened issue. If that's not the case, you should first create an issue so we can discuss about it. This procedure is here to avoid wasting your time in case the PR will be rejected. For minor changes (e.g. : typo, quick fix, ...), opening an issue might be facultative. **Don't forget to edit the documentations when needed !**
