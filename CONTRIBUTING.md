# Contributing to BunkerWeb

First of all, thank you for being here and showing your support for the project!

We welcome many types of contributions, whether they are technical or not. Every piece of community feedback, work, or help is — and will always be — appreciated.

## Talk about the project

The first thing you can do is talk about the project. You can share it on social media (by the way, you can also follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bunkerity/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bunkerity), and [GitHub](https://github.com/bunkerity)), write a blog post about it, or simply tell your friends/colleagues that it's an awesome project.

## Join the community

You can join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fTf46FmtyD), the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/discussions), and the [/r/BunkerWeb](https://www.reddit.com/r/BunkerWeb) subreddit to talk about the project and help others.

## Reporting bugs / Requesting features

The preferred way to report bugs or request features is by using [issues](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/issues). Before opening a new one, please check whether a related issue is already open using the filters bar. When creating a new issue, please select and fill out the "Bug report" or "Feature request" template.

## Code contribution

The preferred way to contribute code is through [pull requests](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/pulls). Before creating a pull request, please check whether your code relates to an open issue. If not, you should first create an issue so we can discuss it — this is to avoid wasting your time in case the PR is rejected. For minor changes (e.g., typos, quick fixes, etc.), opening an issue might be optional.

**Don't forget to update the documentation when needed!**
