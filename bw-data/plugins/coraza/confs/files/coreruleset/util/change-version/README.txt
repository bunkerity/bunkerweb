Change version in CRS
=====================

This page describes how can you change the version strings in CRS rules.


Goals
-----
The problem is change the version string in CRS rules isn't trivial. Version
string used for mark all rule by the ver action, mark the whole file in a
comment, or mark the rule set with SecComponentSignature. Few examples:

 * in a rule: SecRule ARGS "foo" "id:1,phase:1,ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.3.0',pass"
 * comment: # OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set ver.3.3.0
 * config directive: SecComponentSignature "OWASP_CRS/3.3.0"

There are many other pattern which look-a-like version string, but that
isn't it.

The main task is replace only the real version strings by the new one.

The Python script below helps to do that on the whole rule set or any unique
file.

Prerequisites
-------------
 * Python3 interpreter
 * msc_pyparser
 * CRS rule set

You can install the msc_pyparser through PIP - that's the recommended method,
see the instructions.

If you already have this package, don't forget to update it before you start
the work:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade msc_pyparser


Usage
-----
The script expects three mandatory and one optional arguments:

* input file or directory
* output directory
* version string for ver actions and SecComponentSignature - these are always
  the same and optionally, the version string for comments

Please note that the input can be a single file (eg.
'coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-901-INITIALIZATION.conf' or a directory with meta
name, eg 'coreruleset/rules/*.conf'. Also note that the output argument is
always a directory where the script puts the transformed file or files.

Run the script
--------------
Consider you want to change only the ver and SecComponentSignature values by a
new one, eg: OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev. The current value is OWASP_CRS/3.3.0. The
next command will solve this:

mkdir /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new
$ ./change-version.py "/path/to/coreruleset/rules/*.conf" /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new "OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev"
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-903.9005-CPANEL-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-903.9008-PHPMYADMIN-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf
...
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-930-APPLICATION-ATTACK-LFI.conf
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-912-DOS-PROTECTION.conf

The new files will placed under the /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new, now make a diff:

$ for f in `ls -1 /path/to/coreruleset/rules/*.conf`; do b=`basename ${f}`; diff ${f} /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new/${b}; done
28c28
< SecComponentSignature "OWASP_CRS/3.3.0"
---
> SecComponentSignature "OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev"
61c61
<     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.3.0',\
---
>     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev',\
79c79
<     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.3.0',\
---
>     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev',\
...

As you can see, the comments have been left untouched.

In the next example, we can replace them too:

$ ./change-version.py "/path/to/coreruleset/rules/*.conf" /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new "OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev" "3.4.0-dev"
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-903.9005-CPANEL-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-903.9008-PHPMYADMIN-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf
...
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-930-APPLICATION-ATTACK-LFI.conf
Working with file: /path/to/coreruleset/rules/REQUEST-912-DOS-PROTECTION.conf

Run the diff again:

$ for f in `ls -1 /path/to/coreruleset/rules/*.conf`; do b=`basename ${f}`; diff ${f} /path/to/coreruleset/rules_new/${b}; done
2c2
< # OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set ver.3.3.0
---
> # OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set ver.3.4.0-dev
28c28
< SecComponentSignature "OWASP_CRS/3.3.0"
---
> SecComponentSignature "OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev"
61c61
<     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.3.0',\
---
>     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev',\
79c79
<     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.3.0',\
---
>     ver:'OWASP_CRS/3.4.0-dev',\
...

As you can see, the version string at the end of comment line has changed in line 2.
