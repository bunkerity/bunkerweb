# Transaction log will contain the information on all log collector

TransactionLog      "mlogc-transaction.log"

# The error log level controls how much detail there
# will be in the error log. The levels are as follows:
#   0 - NONE
#   1 - ERROR
#   2 - WARNING
#   3 - NOTICE
#   4 - DEBUG
#   5 - DEBUG2
#
ErrorLogLevel       3

# How many concurrent connections to the server
# are we allowed to open at the same time? Log collector uses
# multiple connections in order to speed up audit log transfer.
# This is especially needed when the communication takes place
# over a slow link (e.g. not over a LAN).
MaxConnections      10

# How many requests a worker will process before recycling itself.
# This is to help prevent problems due to any memory leaks that may
# exists.  If this is set to 0, then no maximum is imposed. The default
# is 1000 requests per worker (the number of workers is controlled by the
# MaxConnections limit).
MaxWorkerRequests   1000

# The time each connection will sit idle before being reused,
# in milliseconds. Increase if you don't want ModSecurity Console
# to be hit with too many log collector requests.
TransactionDelay    50

# The time to wait before initialization on startup in milliseconds.
# Increase if mlogc is starting faster then termination when the
# sensor is reloaded.
StartupDelay        5000

# How often is the pending audit log entry data going to be written
# to a file. The default is 15 seconds.
CheckpointInterval  15

# If the server fails all threads will back down until the
# problem is sorted. The management thread will periodically
# launch a thread to test the server. The default is to test
# once in 60 seconds.
ServerErrorTimeout  60

# The following two parameters are not used yet, but
# reserved for future expansion.
# KeepAlive         150
# KeepAliveTimeout  300
