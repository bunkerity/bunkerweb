CRS 2.x to 3.x migration utility
================================

In CRS 3.0, we have renumbered the rules to be more logical and helpful.
The new rule file names now correspond with the rule IDs in the file.
First rule of a given file is usually 9XX100, then the rules continue
in steps of ten. Related rules/siblings follow with a single digit
change (9XX101, etc.).

This utility replaces CRS 2 ruleIds with their CRS 3 counterparts.
You can use it when migrating your CRS 2 exclusion/.conf files to CRS 3.0
or higher.

Example usage:

	./update.py -f your_old_modsec_conf.conf

Rules which have been removed in CRS 3 are listed with the new ID 000000 in the
CSV file. This means that the former rule is no longer part of CRS 3. If after
replacement you find a string 000000 in your config files, you can likely
remove that exclusion or special case.

If you want to create your own tooling for this migration, you can use
the file idNumbering.csv in this directory. It lists the old rule IDs of
CRS 2.2, together with the corresponding rule IDs in CRS 3.0.

A rule renumbering is painful for all existing installations. But we really
think that the rule IDs lacked sense and reason, and we are confident future
maintenance will be much easier once this is done. We do not plan to change
rule IDs after this. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
