Welcome to the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) documentation.

The latest version of the documentation can be read at:
https://coreruleset.org/docs/

The OWASP CRS documentation is generated by Hugo and is stored
in a separate Github repository:
https://github.com/coreruleset/documentation/

While the documentation is available as part of the CRS project,
it is provided in the form of a Git submodule. Using a Git
submodule allows us to update the documentation without making
changes to the main rule repository.

You can download the documentation using git:

    git submodule update --init docs
