##! Word list for rule 932220 (RCE Unix command injection)
##!
##! This list comes from (and should be in sync) the `unix-shell.data` file.

##! Not all of the prefixes for the command words will be legal.
##! We've decided to use the same prefix as in 932100 and 932105 here,
##! because we don't know exactly what things are possible after a pipe and
##! we don't want to overcomplicate things by introducing another prefix variation.
##! Not all of the prefixes matched by the expression will actually be valid.
