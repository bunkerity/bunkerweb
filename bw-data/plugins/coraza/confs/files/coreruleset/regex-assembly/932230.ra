##! Word list for rule 932120 (RCE for commands of two and three character words)
##!
##! Per discussion in https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2632, we decided
##! to extend the cmdline evasion regex, so we are applying the evasion to a subset of the
##! original 93210(0|5) rules: the subset of commands from two or three characters that might pose
##! a greater risk of false positives.
