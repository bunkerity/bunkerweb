#
# The purpose of this file is to hold LOCAL exceptions for your site.  The
# types of rules that would go into this file are one where you want to
# short-circuit inspection and allow certain transactions to pass through
# inspection or if you want to alter rules that are applied.
#
# This file is named REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS.conf.example for a
# very specific reason. Files affixed with the .example extension are designed
# to contain user created/modified data. The '.example'. extension should be
# renamed to end in .conf. The advantage of this is that when OWASP CRS is
# updated, the updates will not overwrite a user generated configuration file.
#
# As a result of this design paradigm users are encouraged NOT to directly
# modify rules. Instead they should use this
# REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS and the
# RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS file to modify OWASP rules using
# methods similar to the examples specified below.
#
# REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS and
# RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS serve different purposes. ModSecurity
# effectively maintains two different context: startup, and per transaction.
# As a rule, directives are processed within the startup context. While they
# can affect the per transaction context they generally remain fixed during the
# execution of ModSecurity.
#
# As a result if one wanted to disable a rule at bootup the SecRuleRemoveById
# directive or one of its siblings would have to be placed AFTER the rule is
# listed, otherwise it will not have knowledge of the rules existence (since
# these rules are read in at the same time). This means that when using
# directives that effect SecRules, these exceptions should be placed AFTER all
# the existing rules. This is why RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS is
# designed such that it loads LAST.
#
# Conversely, ModSecurity supports several actions that can change the state of
# the underlying configuration during the per transaction context, this is when
# rules are being processed. Generally, these are accomplished by using the
# 'ctl' action. As these are part of a rule, they will be evaluated in the
# order rules are applied (by physical location, considering phases). As a
# result of this ordering a 'ctl' action should be placed with consideration to
# when it will be executed. This is particularly relevant for the 'ctl' options
# that involve modifying ID's (such as ruleRemoveById). In these cases it is
# important that such rules are placed BEFORE the rule ID they will affect.
# Unlike the setup context, by the time we process rules in the per-transaction
# context, we are already aware of all the rule ID's. It is by this logic that
# we include rules such as this BEFORE all the remaining rules.  As a result
# REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS is designed to load FIRST.
#
# As a general rule:
# ctl:ruleEngine            -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveById        -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveByMsg       -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveByTag       -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById  -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveTargetByMsg -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
# ctl:ruleRemoveTargetByTag -> place in REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS
#
# SecRuleRemoveById         -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleRemoveByMsg        -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleRemoveByTag        -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleUpdateActionById   -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleUpdateTargetById   -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleUpdateTargetByMsg  -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
# SecRuleUpdateTargetByTag  -> place in RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS
#
#
# What follows are a group of examples that show you how to perform rule
# exclusions.
#
#
# Example Exclusion Rule: Disable inspection for an authorized client
#
# This ruleset allows you to control how ModSecurity will handle traffic
# originating from Authorized Vulnerability Scanning (AVS) sources.  See
# related blog post -
# https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/updated-advanced-topic-of-the-week-handling-authorized-scanning-traffic/
#
# Allow List ASV network block (no blocking or logging of AVS traffic) Update
# IP network block as appropriate for your AVS traffic
#
# ModSec Rule Exclusion: Disable Rule Engine for known ASV IP
# SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 192.168.1.100" \
#     "id:1000,\
#     phase:1,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ctl:ruleEngine=Off"
#
#
# Example Exclusion Rule: Removing a specific ARGS parameter from inspection
#                         for an individual rule
#
# This rule shows how to conditionally exclude the "password"
# parameter for rule 942100 when the REQUEST_URI is /index.php
# ModSecurity Rule Exclusion: 942100 SQL Injection Detected via libinjection
#
# SecRule REQUEST_URI "@beginsWith /index.php" \
#     "id:1001,\
#     phase:1,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=942100;ARGS:password"
#
#
# Example Exclusion Rule: Removing a specific ARGS parameter from inspection
#                         for only certain attacks
#
# Attack rules within the CRS are tagged, with tags such as 'attack-lfi',
# 'attack-sqli', 'attack-xss', 'attack-injection-php', et cetera.
#
# ModSecurity Rule Exclusion: Disable inspection of ARGS:pwd
#                             for all rules tagged attack-sqli
# SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@endsWith /wp-login.php" \
#     "id:1002,\
#     phase:2,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ctl:ruleRemoveTargetByTag=attack-sqli;ARGS:pwd"
#

# Example Exclusion Rule: Removing a specific ARGS parameter from inspection
#                         for all CRS rules
#
# This rule illustrates that we can use tagging very effectively to allow list a
# common false positive across an entire ModSecurity instance. This can be done
# because every rule in OWASP_CRS is tagged with OWASP_CRS. This will NOT
# affect custom rules.
#
# ModSecurity Rule Exclusion: Disable inspection of ARGS:pwd
#                             for all CRS rules
# SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@endsWith /wp-login.php" \
#     "id:1003,\
#     phase:2,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ctl:ruleRemoveTargetByTag=OWASP_CRS;ARGS:pwd"

#
# Example Exclusion Rule: Removing a range of rules
#
# This rule illustrates that we can remove a rule range via a ctl action.
# This uses the fact, that rules are grouped by topic in rule files covering
# a certain id range.
#
# ModSecurity Rule Exclusion: Disable all SQLi and XSS rules
# SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@beginsWith /admin" \
#     "id:1004,\
#     phase:2,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ctl:ruleRemoveById=941000-942999"
#
#
# The application-specific rule exclusion plugins
# (see: https://github.com/coreruleset/plugin-registry)
# provide additional examples which can be useful then tuning a service.


#
# Example Rule: Allow monitoring tools and scripts
#
# Uncomment this rule to allow all requests from trusted IPs and User-Agent.
# This can be useful for monitoring tools like Monit, Nagios, or other agents.
# For example, if you're using AWS Load Balancer, you may need to trust all
# requests from "10.0.0.0/8" subnet that come with the user-agent
# "ELB-HealthChecker/2.0". By doing this, all requests that match these
# conditions will not be matched against the following rules:
#
# - id: 911100 (allowed methods)
# - id: 913100,913110,913120,913101,913102 (scan detection)
# - id: 920280 (missing/empty host header)
# - id: 920350 (IP address in host header)
# - tag: attack-disclosure (all RESPONSE-*-DATA-LEAKAGES rules)
#
# SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 10.0.0.0/8" \
#    "id:1005,\
#    phase:1,\
#    pass,\
#    nolog,\
#    chain"
#    SecRule REQUEST_METHOD "@pm GET HEAD" "chain"
#       SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "@pm ELB-HealthChecker" \
#           "ctl:ruleRemoveById=911100,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=913100,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=913110,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=913120,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=913101,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=913102,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=920280,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveById=920350,\
#           ctl:ruleRemoveByTag=attack-disclosure"
