"""
This script confirms that the naming of all symbols and identifiers in Mbed TLS
are consistent with the house style and are also self-consistent. It only runs
on Linux and macOS since it depends on nm.

It contains two major Python classes, CodeParser and NameChecker. They both have
a comprehensive "run-all" function (comprehensive_parse() and perform_checks())
but the individual functions can also be used for specific needs.

CodeParser makes heavy use of regular expressions to parse the code, and is
dependent on the current code formatting. Many Python C parser libraries require
preprocessed C code, which means no macro parsing. Compiler tools are also not
very helpful when we want the exact location in the original source (which
becomes impossible when e.g. comments are stripped).

NameChecker performs the following checks:

- All exported and available symbols in the library object files, are explicitly
  declared in the header files. This uses the nm command.
- All macros, constants, and identifiers (function names, struct names, etc)
  follow the required regex pattern.
- Typo checking: All words that begin with MBED|PSA exist as macros or constants.

The script returns 0 on success, 1 on test failure, and 2 if there is a script
error. It must be run from Mbed TLS root.
