The SSL plugin provides robust SSL/TLS encryption capabilities for your BunkerWeb-protected websites. This core component enables secure HTTPS connections by configuring and optimizing cryptographic protocols, ciphers, and related security settings to protect data in transit between clients and your web services.

**How it works:**

1. When a client initiates an HTTPS connection to your website, BunkerWeb handles the SSL/TLS handshake using your configured settings.
2. The plugin enforces modern encryption protocols and strong cipher suites while disabling known vulnerable options.
3. Optimized SSL session parameters improve connection performance without sacrificing security.
4. Certificate presentation is configured according to best practices to ensure compatibility and security.

!!! success "Security Benefits"
    - **Data Protection:** Encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
    - **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of your server to clients
    - **Integrity:** Ensures data hasn't been tampered with during transmission
    - **Modern Standards:** Configured for compliance with industry best practices and security standards

### How to Use

Follow these steps to configure and use the SSL feature:

1. **Configure protocols:** Choose which SSL/TLS protocol versions to support using the `SSL_PROTOCOLS` setting.
2. **Select cipher suites:** Specify the encryption strength using the `SSL_CIPHERS_LEVEL` setting or provide custom ciphers with `SSL_CIPHERS_CUSTOM`.
3. **Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection:** Set up automatic redirection using the `AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS` or `REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS` settings.

### Configuration Settings

| Setting                       | Default           | Context   | Multiple | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS`      | `no`              | multisite | no       | **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** When set to `yes`, all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.                           |
| `AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS` | `yes`             | multisite | no       | **Auto Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** When set to `yes`, automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS if HTTPS is detected.     |
| `SSL_PROTOCOLS`               | `TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3` | multisite | no       | **SSL Protocols:** Space-separated list of SSL/TLS protocols to support.                                            |
| `SSL_CIPHERS_LEVEL`           | `modern`          | multisite | no       | **SSL Ciphers Level:** Preset security level for cipher suites (`modern`, `intermediate`, or `old`).                |
| `SSL_CIPHERS_CUSTOM`          |                   | multisite | no       | **Custom SSL Ciphers:** Colon-separated list of cipher suites to use for SSL/TLS connections (overrides level).     |
| `SSL_SESSION_CACHE_SIZE`      | `10m`             | multisite | no       | **SSL Session Cache Size:** Size of the SSL session cache (e.g., `10m`, `512k`). Set to `off` or `none` to disable. |

!!! tip "SSL Labs Testing"
    After configuring your SSL settings, use the [Qualys SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to verify your configuration and check for potential security issues. A proper BunkerWeb SSL configuration should achieve an A+ rating.

!!! warning "Protocol Selection"
    Support for older protocols like SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1 is intentionally disabled by default due to known vulnerabilities. Only enable these protocols if you absolutely need to support legacy clients and understand the security implications of doing so.

### Example Configurations

=== "Modern Security (Default)"

    The default configuration that provides strong security while maintaining compatibility with modern browsers:

    ```yaml
    LISTEN_HTTPS: "yes"
    SSL_PROTOCOLS: "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
    SSL_CIPHERS_LEVEL: "modern"
    AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "yes"
    REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "no"
    ```

=== "Maximum Security"

    Configuration focused on maximum security, potentially with reduced compatibility for older clients:

    ```yaml
    LISTEN_HTTPS: "yes"
    SSL_PROTOCOLS: "TLSv1.3"
    SSL_CIPHERS_LEVEL: "modern"
    AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "yes"
    REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "yes"
    ```

=== "Legacy Compatibility"

    Configuration with broader compatibility for older clients (use only if necessary):

    ```yaml
    LISTEN_HTTPS: "yes"
    SSL_PROTOCOLS: "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
    SSL_CIPHERS_LEVEL: "old"
    AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "no"
    ```

=== "Custom Ciphers"

    Configuration using custom cipher specification:

    ```yaml
    LISTEN_HTTPS: "yes"
    SSL_PROTOCOLS: "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
    SSL_CIPHERS_CUSTOM: "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305"
    AUTO_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS: "yes"
    ```
