The CrowdSec plugin integrates BunkerWeb with the CrowdSec security engine, providing an additional layer of protection against various cyber threats. This plugin acts as a [CrowdSec](https://crowdsec.net/?utm_source=external-docs&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-docs) bouncer, denying requests based on decisions from the CrowdSec API.

CrowdSec is a modern, open-source security engine that detects and blocks malicious IP addresses based on behavioral analysis and collective intelligence from its community. You can also configure [scenarios](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/concepts?utm_source=external-docs&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-docs#scenarios) to automatically ban IP addresses based on suspicious behavior, benefiting from a crowdsourced blacklist.

**How it works:**

1. The CrowdSec engine analyzes logs and detects suspicious activities on your infrastructure.
2. When malicious activity is detected, CrowdSec creates a decision to block the offending IP address.
3. BunkerWeb, acting as a bouncer, queries the CrowdSec Local API for decisions about incoming requests.
4. If a client's IP address has an active block decision, BunkerWeb denies access to the protected services.
5. Optionally, the Application Security Component can perform deep request inspection for enhanced security.

!!! success "Key benefits"

      1. **Community-Powered Security:** Benefit from threat intelligence shared across the CrowdSec user community.
      2. **Behavioral Analysis:** Detect sophisticated attacks based on behavior patterns, not just signatures.
      3. **Lightweight Integration:** Minimal performance impact on your BunkerWeb instance.
      4. **Multi-Level Protection:** Combine perimeter defense (IP blocking) with application security for in-depth protection.

### Setup

=== "Docker"
    **Acquisition file**

    You will need to run a CrowdSec instance and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. Since BunkerWeb is based on NGINX, you can use the `nginx` value for the `type` parameter in your acquisition file (assuming that BunkerWeb logs are stored as is without additional data):

    ```yaml
    filenames:
      - /var/log/bunkerweb.log
    labels:
      type: nginx
    ```

    **Application Security Component (*optional*)**

    CrowdSec also provides an [Application Security Component](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/appsec/intro?utm_source=external-docs&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-docs) that can be used to protect your application from attacks. If you want to use it, you must create another acquisition file for the AppSec Component:

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
      type: appsec
    listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    **Syslog**

    For container-based integrations, we recommend redirecting the logs of the BunkerWeb container to a syslog service so CrowdSec can access them easily. Here is an example configuration for syslog-ng that will store raw logs coming from BunkerWeb to a local `/var/log/bunkerweb.log` file:

    ```syslog
    @version: 4.8

    source s_net {
        udp(
            ip("0.0.0.0")
        );
    };

    template t_imp {
        template("$MSG\n");
        template_escape(no);
    };

    destination d_file {
        file("/var/log/bunkerweb.log" template(t_imp));
    };

    log {
        source(s_net);
        destination(d_file);
    };
    ```

    **Docker Compose**

    Here is the docker-compose boilerplate that you can use (donâ€™t forget to update the bouncer key):

    ```yaml
    x-bw-env: &bw-env
      # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for both services
      API_WHITELIST_IP: "127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24" # Make sure to set the correct IP range so the scheduler can send the configuration to the instance

=== "Linux"

    You need to install CrowdSec and configure it to parse BunkerWeb logs. Follow the [official documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec?utm_source=external-docs&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=bunker-web-docs#scenarios).

    To enable CrowdSec to parse BunkerWeb logs, add the following lines to your acquisition file located at `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    filenames:
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/access.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/error.log
      - /var/log/bunkerweb/modsec_audit.log
    labels:
        type: nginx
    ```

    Now, add your custom bouncer to the CrowdSec API using the `cscli` tool:

    ```shell
    sudo cscli bouncers add crowdsec-bunkerweb-bouncer/v1.6
    ```

    !!! warning "API key"
        Keep the key generated by the `cscli` command; you will need it later.

    Then restart the CrowdSec service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    **Application Security Component (*optional*)**

    If you want to use the AppSec Component, you must create another acquisition file for it located at `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
        type: appsec
    listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

    You will also need to install the AppSec Component's collections:

    ```shell
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching
    sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules
    ```

    Finally, restart the CrowdSec service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
    ```

    **Settings**

    Configure the plugin by adding the following settings to your BunkerWeb configuration file:

    ```env
    USE_CROWDSEC=yes
    CROWDSEC_API=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    CROWDSEC_API_KEY=<The key provided by cscli>
    # Comment if you don't want to use the AppSec Component
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422
    ```

    Finally, reload the BunkerWeb service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl reload bunkerweb
    ```

=== "All-in-one"

    The BunkerWeb All-In-One (AIO) Docker image comes with CrowdSec fully integrated. You don't need to set up a separate CrowdSec instance or manually configure acquisition files for BunkerWeb logs when using the internal CrowdSec agent.

    Refer to the [All-In-One (AIO) Image integration documentation](integrations.md#crowdsec-integration).

!!! info "About Operation Modes"
    - **Live mode** queries the CrowdSec API for each incoming request, providing real-time protection at the cost of higher latency.
    - **Stream mode** periodically downloads all decisions from the CrowdSec API and caches them locally, reducing latency with a slight delay in applying new decisions.

### Example Configurations

=== "Basic Configuration"

    This is a simple configuration for when CrowdSec runs on the same host:

    ```yaml
    USE_CROWDSEC: "yes"
    CROWDSEC_API: "http://crowdsec:8080"
    CROWDSEC_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
    CROWDSEC_MODE: "live"
    ```

=== "Advanced Configuration with AppSec"

    A more comprehensive configuration including the Application Security Component:

    ```yaml
    USE_CROWDSEC: "yes"
    CROWDSEC_API: "http://crowdsec:8080"
    CROWDSEC_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
    CROWDSEC_MODE: "stream"
    CROWDSEC_UPDATE_FREQUENCY: "30"
    CROWDSEC_EXCLUDE_LOCATION: "/health,/metrics"

    # AppSec Configuration
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_URL: "http://crowdsec:7422"
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_FAILURE_ACTION: "deny"
    CROWDSEC_ALWAYS_SEND_TO_APPSEC: "yes"
    CROWDSEC_APPSEC_SSL_VERIFY: "yes"
    ```
