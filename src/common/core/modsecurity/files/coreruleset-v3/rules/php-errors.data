# The contents of this list come from the [PHP source code](https://github.com/php/php-src).
#
# There are different types of errors that might be thrown. An easy way to discover them is to
# get any text that comes from the error handling functions: `zend_error`, `zend_throw_error`, `soap_error0`, etc.
# Using the regexp `_error([0-9])?\(` will give you all. And you can see them using:
# `grep -h -E -r -o --exclude="*.phpt" '\w+_error([0-9])?\(' * | sort | uniq`
#
# After getting the list, there are two different types of errors: those with literal text, and those that include
# print format args like `%s`, `%d`, `%zu`, etc. We sort them in two groups.
#
# The first group is just anything without formatting args. Only text, sorted ascending. Command used:
#   - `grep -E -h -r --exclude="*.phpt" '_error([0-9])?\(' * | awk -F\" '{ print $2;} ' | sed -e 's/ \\$/ "/g' | sort | uniq | grep -v '%'`
# Post processing might be necessary to adjust strings that can cause false positives, such as
# - line is very short
# - line is a (partial) common English sentence, like `Can use`, `Attribute`, etc.
# - text coming from php unit/regression tests, like 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_bug_71863`
#
# The second group will be the part with format strings. Only text, sorted ascending.
# This will need a more careful processing. The format string will appear in the text result,
# but it will (of course) be substituted by some variable value. So we need to clean more text here.
# The easiest way is to split a line whenever a format string is found. This will shorten the texts but,
# then we can sort out the ones we don't want to include more easily.
# We also remove:
# - text with just one word (likely to be FP), or one word, one space (optional) and one non-word (optional),
#   which will match things like `Collect "`, `Method` or `Class `.
#
# Command used:
#   - `grep -E -h -r --exclude="*.phpt" '_error([0-9])?\(' * | awk -F\" '/%/ { print $2;} ' | sed -e 's/ \\$/ "/g' -e 's/%[zlp][ud]/\n/g' -e 's/%[a-z]/\n/g'  -e 's/%\.\*s/\n/g' | sort | uniq | grep -E -v '^\w+\s?\W?$' | grep -E -v '^\W+$'
#
# Anything that is too short, or nonsense, we remove.

# Group without format strings

GD doesn't support these unusual images. Edit your jmorecfg.h file to specify the correct precision and completely 'make clean' and 'make install' libjpeg again. Sorry
