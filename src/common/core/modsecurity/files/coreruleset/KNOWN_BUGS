== OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) KNOWN BUGS ==

== Report Bugs/Issues to GitHub Issues Tracker or the mailinglist ==

* There are still false positives for standard web applications in
  the default install (paranoia level 1). Please report these when
  you encounter them.
  False Positives from paranoia level 2 rules are less interesting,
  as we expect users to write exclusion rules for their alerts in
  the higher paranoia levels.
* Permanent blocking of clients is based on a previous user agent / IP
  combination. Changing the user agent will thus allow to bypass
  this new filter. The plan is to allow for a purely IP based
  filter in the future.
* Apache 2.4 prior to 2.4.11 is affected by a bug in parsing multi-line
  configuration directives, which causes Apache to fail during startup
  with an error such as:
    Error parsing actions: Unknown action: \\
    Action 'configtest' failed.
  This bug is known to plague RHEL/Centos 7 below v7.4 or
  httpd v2.4.6 release 67 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS users.

  We advise to upgrade your Apache version. If upgrading is not possible,
  we have provided a script in the util/join-multiline-rules directory
  which converts the rules into a format that works around the bug.
  You have to re-run this script whenever you modify or update 
  the CRS rules.
* Debian up to and including Jessie lacks YAJL/JSON support in ModSecurity,
  which causes the following error in the Apache ErrorLog or SecAuditLog:
    'ModSecurity: JSON support was not enabled.'
  JSON support was enabled in Debian's package version 2.8.0-4 (Nov 2014).
  You can either use backports.debian.org to install the latest ModSecurity
  release or disable rule id 200001.
* As of CRS version 3.0.1, support has been added for the application/soap+xml MIME
  type by default, as specified in RFC 3902. OF IMPORTANCE, application/soap+xml is
  indicative that XML will be provided. In accordance with this, ModSecurity's XML
  Request Body Processor should also be configured to support this MIME type. Within
  the ModSecurity project, commit 5e4e2af 
  (https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/commit/5e4e2af7a6f07854fee6ed36ef4a381d4e03960e) 
  has been merged to support this endeavour. However, if you are running a modified or
  preexisting version of the modsecurity.conf provided by this repository, you may
  wish to upgrade rule '200000' accordingly. The rule now appears as follows:

```
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Type "(?:application(?:/soap\+|/)|text/)xml" \
     "id:'200000',phase:1,t:none,t:lowercase,pass,nolog,ctl:requestBodyProcessor=XML"
```
