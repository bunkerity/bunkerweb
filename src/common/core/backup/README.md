# Backup Plugin

The Backup plugin provides an automated backup solution to protect your BunkerWeb data. This feature ensures the safety and availability of your important database by creating regular backups according to your preferred schedule. Backups are stored in a designated location and can be easily managed through both automated processes and manual commands.

**How it works:**

1. Your database is automatically backed up according to the schedule you set (daily, weekly, or monthly).
2. Backups are stored in a specified directory on your system.
3. Old backups are automatically rotated based on your retention settings.
4. You can manually create backups, list existing backups, or restore from a backup at any time.
5. Before any restore operation, the current state is automatically backed up as a safety measure.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to configure and use the Backup feature:

1. **Enable the feature:** The backup feature is enabled by default. If needed, you can control this with the `USE_BACKUP` setting.
2. **Configure backup schedule:** Choose how often backups should occur by setting the `BACKUP_SCHEDULE` parameter.
3. **Set retention policy:** Specify how many backups to keep using the `BACKUP_ROTATION` setting.
4. **Define storage location:** Choose where backups will be stored using the `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` setting.
5. **Use CLI commands:** Manage backups manually with the `bwcli plugin backup` commands when needed.

## Command Line Interface

The Backup plugin provides several CLI commands to manage your backups:

```bash
# List all available backups
bwcli plugin backup list

# Create a manual backup
bwcli plugin backup save

# Create a backup in a custom location
bwcli plugin backup save --directory /path/to/custom/location

# Restore from the most recent backup
bwcli plugin backup restore

# Restore from a specific backup file
bwcli plugin backup restore /path/to/backup/backup-sqlite-2023-08-15_12-34-56.zip
```

!!! tip "Safety First"
    Before any restore operation, the Backup plugin automatically creates a backup of your current database state in a temporary location. This provides an extra safeguard in case you need to revert the restore operation.

!!! warning "Database Compatibility"
    The Backup plugin supports SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, and PostgreSQL databases. Oracle databases are not currently supported for backup and restore operations.

```

### Weekly Backups with Extended Retention

Configuration for less frequent backups with longer retention:
