# Bad Behavior Plugin

The Bad Behavior plugin protects your website by automatically detecting and
banning IP addresses that generate too many errors or "bad" HTTP status codes
within a specified period of time. This helps defend against brute force
attacks, web scrapers, vulnerability scanners, and other malicious activities
that might generate numerous error responses.

Attackers often generate "suspicious" HTTP status codes when probing for or
exploiting vulnerabilitiesâ€”codes that a typical user is unlikely to trigger
within a given time frame. By detecting this behavior, BunkerWeb can
automatically ban the offending IP address, forcing the attacker to use a new
IP address to continue their attempts.

**How it works:**

1. The plugin monitors HTTP responses from your site.
2. When a visitor receives a "bad" HTTP status code (like 400, 401, 403, 404,
   etc.), the counter for that IP address is incremented.
3. If an IP address exceeds the configured threshold of bad status codes
   within the specified time period, the IP is automatically banned.
4. Banned IPs can be blocked either at the service level (just for the
   specific site) or globally (across all sites), depending on your
   configuration.
5. Bans automatically expire after the configured ban duration, or remain
   permanent if configured with `0`.

!!! success "Key benefits"

      1. **Automatic Protection:** Detects and blocks potentially malicious
         clients without requiring manual intervention.
      2. **Customizable Rules:** Fine-tune what constitutes "bad behavior"
         based on your specific needs.
      3. **Resource Conservation:** Prevents malicious actors from consuming
         server resources with repeated invalid requests.
      4. **Flexible Scope:** Choose whether bans should apply just to the
         current service or globally across all services.
      5. **Ban Duration Control:** Set temporary bans that automatically
         expire after the configured duration, or permanent bans that remain
         until manually removed.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to configure and use the Bad Behavior feature:

1. **Enable the feature:** The Bad Behavior feature is enabled by default. If
   needed, you can control this with the `USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR` setting.
2. **Configure status codes:** Define which HTTP status codes should be
   considered "bad" using the `BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES` setting.
3. **Set threshold values:** Determine how many "bad" responses should trigger
   a ban using the `BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD` setting.
4. **Configure time periods:** Specify the duration for counting bad responses
   and the ban duration using the `BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME` and
   `BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME` settings.
5. **Choose ban scope:** Decide whether the bans should apply only to the
   current service or globally across all services using the
   `BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_SCOPE` setting.

!!! tip "Stream Mode"
    In **stream mode**, only the `444` status code is considered "bad" and
    will trigger this behavior.

!!! warning "False Positives"
    Be careful when setting the threshold and count time. Setting these values
    too low may inadvertently ban legitimate users who encounter errors while
    browsing your site.

!!! tip "Tuning Your Configuration"
    Start with conservative settings (higher threshold, shorter ban time) and
    adjust based on your specific needs and traffic patterns. Monitor your
    logs to ensure that legitimate users are not mistakenly banned.

## Example Configurations

=== "Default Configuration"

    The default configuration provides a balanced approach suitable for most
    websites:

    ```yaml
    USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR: "yes"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES: "400 401 403 404 405 429 444"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD: "10"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME: "60"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME: "86400"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_SCOPE: "service"
    ```

=== "Strict Configuration"

    For high-security applications where you want to be more aggressive in
    banning potential threats:

    ```yaml
    USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR: "yes"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES: "400 401 403 404 405 429 444 500 502 503"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD: "5"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME: "120"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME: "604800"  # 7 days
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_SCOPE: "global" # Ban across all services
    ```

=== "Lenient Configuration"

    For sites with high legitimate traffic where you want to avoid false
    positives:

    ```yaml
    USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR: "yes"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES: "401 403 429"  # Only count unauthorized, forbidden, and rate limited
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD: "20"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME: "30"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME: "3600"  # 1 hour
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_SCOPE: "service"
    ```

=== "Permanent Ban Configuration"

    For scenarios where you want detected attackers permanently banned until
    manually unbanned:

    ```yaml
    USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR: "yes"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_STATUS_CODES: "400 401 403 404 405 429 444"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_THRESHOLD: "10"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_COUNT_TIME: "60"
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_TIME: "0"  # Permanent ban (never expires)
    BAD_BEHAVIOR_BAN_SCOPE: "global" # Ban across all services
    ```
