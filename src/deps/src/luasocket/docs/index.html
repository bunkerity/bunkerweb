<h2 id="whatis">What is LuaSocket?</h2>

<p>
LuaSocket  is a  <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>  extension library
that is composed by two parts: a C core that provides  support for the TCP
and UDP transport layers, and a set of Lua modules that add support for
functionality commonly needed by applications that deal with the Internet.
</p>

<p>
The core support has been  implemented so that it  is both efficient and
simple to use.  It is available to any Lua application once it has been
properly initialized by the interpreter in use. The code has been tested
and runs well on several Windows and UNIX platforms. </p>

<p>
Among the support modules, the most commonly used implement the
<a href="smtp.html">SMTP</a>
(sending  e-mails),
<a href="http.html">HTTP</a>
(WWW access)  and
<a href="ftp.html">FTP</a>
(uploading  and downloading files) client
protocols. These provide a very natural and generic interface to the
functionality defined by each protocol.
In addition, you will find that the
<a href="mime.html">MIME</a> (common encodings),
<a href="url.html">URL</a>
(anything you could possible want to do with one) and
<a href="ltn12.html">LTN12</a>
(filters, sinks, sources and pumps) modules can be very handy.
</p>

<p>
The library is available under the same
<a href="http://www.lua.org/copyright.html">
terms and conditions</a> as the Lua language, the MIT license. The idea is
that if you can use Lua in a project, you should also be able to use
LuaSocket.

LuaSocket version 3.1.0 is now available for download!
It is compatible with Lua&nbsp;5.1 through 5.4.
Chances are it works well on most UNIX distributions and Windows flavors.
</p>

<p>
The current version of the library can be found at
the <a href="https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket">LuaSocket
project page</a> on GitHub. Besides the full C and Lua source code
for the library, the distribution contains several examples,
this user's manual and basic test procedures.
</p>

<p> Take a look at the <a
href="installation.html">installation</a> section of the
manual to find out how to properly install the library.
</p>

<!-- thanks +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id="thanks">Special thanks</h2>

<p>
This marks the first release of LuaSocket that
wholeheartedly embraces the open-source development
philosophy. After a long hiatus, Matthew Wild finally
convinced me it was time for a release including IPv6 and
Lua 5.2 support. It was more work than we anticipated.
Special thanks to Sam Roberts, Florian Zeitz, and Paul
Aurich, Liam Devine, Alexey Melnichuk, and everybody else
that has helped bring this library back to life.
