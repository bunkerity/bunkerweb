## Version 3.0.0 highlights
It is been a while since the last release, a lot of work has been done, and I'm glad to finally present a new version of Air Datepicker.

The main goal was to remove jQuery dependency, and I'm happy to announce that Air Datepicker is no longer need any dependency, hurray! :partying_face:  

Now it's written in ES6, uses native css variables for easy customization, and it's all built with webpack.

Soooo, here is the full list of changes:

* no more jQuery
* improve rendering process - remove redundant cell render when selecting date, which gave a large speed boost compared to the old version
* date format tokens now use [Unicode Technical Standard](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table)
* TypeScript support
* added `selectedDates` option, to be able to select dates from the start
* added a possibility to create custom buttons
* now one could change selected range by dragging dates
* added `container` option which allows you to place datepicker in a custom element
* `navTitles` can receive a function and could render dynamically
* `dateFormat` now can receive a function
* `onSelect` and `onRenderCell` callbacks are now receive a single object as an argument instead of multiple parameters
* `selectDate` now receives second parameter with options
* `onChangeMonth`, `onChangeYear`, `onChangeDecades` are replaced with single option `onChangeViewDate`
* localization now must be provided as an object instead of string as it was before
