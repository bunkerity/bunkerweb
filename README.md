# Concepts

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Concepts banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/concepts.svg" />
</p>

You will find more information about the key concepts of BunkerWeb in the [documentation](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/concepts/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github).

## Integrations

The first concept is the integration of BunkerWeb into the target environment. We prefer to use the word "integration" instead of "installation" because one of the goals of BunkerWeb is to integrate seamlessly into existing environments.

The following integrations are officially supported:

- [Docker](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#docker)
- [Linux](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#linux)
- [Docker autoconf](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#docker-autoconf)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#kubernetes)
- [Swarm](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#swarm)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#microsoft-azure)

## Settings

Once BunkerWeb is integrated into your environment, you will need to configure it to serve and protect your web applications.

The configuration of BunkerWeb is done by using what we call the "settings" or "variables." Each setting is identified by a name such as `AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT` or `USE_ANTIBOT`. You can assign values to the settings to configure BunkerWeb.

Here is a dummy example of a BunkerWeb configuration:

```conf
SERVER_NAME=www.example.com
AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT=yes
USE_ANTIBOT=captcha
REFERRER_POLICY=no-referrer
USE_MODSECURITY=no
USE_GZIP=yes
USE_BROTLI=no
```

## Multisite mode

The multisite mode is a crucial concept to understand when using BunkerWeb. Because the goal is to protect web applications, we intrinsically inherit the concept of "virtual host" or "vhost" (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting)) which makes it possible to serve multiple web applications from a single (or a cluster of) instance.

By default, the multisite mode of BunkerWeb is disabled, which means that only one web application will be served and all the settings will be applied to it. The typical use case is when you have a single application to protect: you don't have to worry about the multisite, and the default behavior should be the right one for you.

When multisite mode is enabled, BunkerWeb will serve and protect multiple web applications. Each web application is identified by a unique server name and has its own set of settings. The typical use case is when you have multiple applications to protect and you want to use a single (or a cluster depending on the integration) instance of BunkerWeb.

## Custom configurations

Because meeting all the use cases only using the settings is not an option (even with [external plugins](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/plugins/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github)), you can use custom configurations to solve your specific challenges.

Under the hood, BunkerWeb uses the notorious NGINX web server, that's why you can leverage its configuration system for your specific needs. Custom NGINX configurations can be included in different [contexts](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/#contexts) like HTTP or server (all servers and/or specific server block).

Another core component of BunkerWeb is the ModSecurity Web Application Firewall: you can also use custom configurations to fix some false positives or add custom rules, for example.

## Database

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Database model" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/bunkerweb_db.svg" />
</p>

The state of the current configuration of BunkerWeb is stored in a backend database which contains the following data:

- Settings defined for all the services
- Custom configurations
- BunkerWeb instances
- Metadata about job execution
- Cached files

The following backend databases are supported: SQLite, MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

## Scheduler

To make things automagically work together, a dedicated service called the scheduler is in charge of:

- Storing the settings and custom configurations inside the database
- Executing various tasks (called jobs)
- Generating a configuration which is understood by BunkerWeb
- Being the intermediary for other services (like web UI or autoconf)

In other words, the scheduler is the brain of BunkerWeb.

# Setup

<!--## BunkerWeb Cloud

## Linux

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Linux banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-linux.svg" />
</p>

List of supported Linux distros:

- Debian 12 "Bookworm"
- Debian 13 "Trixie"
- Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy"
- Ubuntu 24.04 "Noble"
- Fedora 41
- Fedora 42
- RHEL 8.10
- RHEL 9.6
- RHEL 10.0

You will find more information in the [Linux section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.5.10/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#linux) of the documentation.

## Docker

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Docker banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-docker.svg" />
</p>

We provide ready-to-use prebuilt images for x64, x86, armv7, and arm64 platforms on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bunkerity).

Docker integration key concepts are:

- **Environment variables** to configure BunkerWeb
- **Scheduler** container to store configuration and execute jobs
- **Networks** to expose ports for clients and connect to upstream web services

You will find more information in the [Docker integration section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#docker) of the documentation.

## Docker autoconf

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Docker autoconf banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-autoconf.svg" />
</p>

The downside of using environment variables is that the container needs to be recreated each time there is an update, which is not very convenient. To counter that issue, you can use another image called **autoconf** which will listen for Docker events and automatically reconfigure BunkerWeb in real-time without recreating the container.

Instead of defining environment variables for the BunkerWeb container, you simply add **labels** to your web applications containers and the **autoconf** will "automagically" take care of the rest.

You will find more information in the [Docker autoconf section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#docker-autoconf) of the documentation.

## Kubernetes

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Kubernetes banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-kubernetes.svg" />
</p>

The autoconf acts as an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) and will configure the BunkerWeb instances according to the [Ingress resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). It also monitors other Kubernetes objects like [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) for custom configurations.

The official [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) for BunkerWeb is available in the [bunkerity/bunkerweb-helm repository](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb-helm).

You will find more information in the [Kubernetes section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#kubernetes) of the documentation.

## Microsoft Azure

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Azure banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-azure.webp" />
</p>

BunkerWeb is referenced in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/fr-fr/marketplace/apps/bunkerity.bunkerweb?tab=Overview) and an ARM template is available in the [misc folder](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/misc/integrations/azure-arm-template.json).

You will find more information in the [Microsoft Azure section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#microsoft-azure) of the documentation.

## Swarm

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Swarm banner" src="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/docs/assets/img/integration-swarm.svg" />
</p>

To automatically configure BunkerWeb instances, a special service, called **autoconf** will listen for Docker Swarm events like service creation or deletion and automatically configure the **BunkerWeb instances** in real-time without downtime.

Like the [Docker autoconf integration](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#docker-autoconf), configuration for web services is defined using labels starting with the special **bunkerweb.** prefix.

You will find more information in the [Swarm section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#swarm) of the documentation.

# Quickstart guide

Once you have set up BunkerWeb with the integration of your choice, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/quickstart-guide/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github) that will cover the installation and first configuration to protect a web service.

# Security tuning

BunkerWeb offers many security features that you can configure with [features](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/features/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github). Even if the default values of settings ensure a minimal "security by default," we strongly recommend you to tune them. By doing so, you will be able to ensure a security level of your choice but also manage false positives.

You will find more information in the [security tuning section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/advanced/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github#security-tuning) of the documentation.

# Settings

As a general rule, when multisite mode is enabled, if you want to apply settings with multisite context to a specific server, you will need to add the primary (first) server name as a prefix like `www.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=captcha` or `myapp.example.com_USE_GZIP=yes`, for example.

When settings are considered as "multiple," it means that you can have multiple groups of settings for the same feature by adding numbers as suffixes like `REVERSE_PROXY_URL_1=/subdir`, `REVERSE_PROXY_HOST_1=http://myhost1`, `REVERSE_PROXY_URL_2=/anotherdir`, `REVERSE_PROXY_HOST_2=http://myhost2`, ... for example.

Check the [features section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/features/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github) of the documentation to get the full list.

# Web UI

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ed56f8-c124-4ca9-b8b3-4be0913b3078

The "Web UI" is a web application that helps you manage your BunkerWeb instance using a user-friendly interface instead of the command-line one.

Here is the list of features offered by the web UI:

- Get a comprehensive view of the blocked attacks
- Start, stop, restart, and reload your BunkerWeb instance
- Add, edit, and delete settings for your web applications
- Add, edit, and delete custom configurations for NGINX and ModSecurity
- Install and uninstall external plugins
- Explore the cached files
- Monitor job execution and restart them when needed
- View the logs and search patterns

You will find more information in the [Web UI section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.5-rc4/web-ui/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github) of the documentation.

# Plugins

BunkerWeb comes with a plugin system to make it possible to easily add new features. Once a plugin is installed, you can manage it using additional settings defined by the plugin.

Here is the list of "official" plugins that we maintain (see the [bunkerweb-plugins](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb-plugins/?utm_campaign=self&utm_source=github) repository for more information):

## Contributing Translations

We welcome contributions to improve or add new locale files!

**How to contribute a translation:**

1. Edit the `src/ui/app/lang_config.py` file to add your language (code, name, flag, english_name).
2. Copy `en.json` as a template in `src/ui/app/static/locales/`, rename it to your language code (e.g., `de.json` for German).
3. Translate the values in your new file.
4. Update the table in `locales/README.md` to add your language and indicate who created/reviewed it.
5. Submit a pull request.

For updates, edit the relevant file and update the provenance table as needed.

See the [locales/README.md](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.5-rc4/src/ui/app/static/locales/README.md) for full guidelines.
