As our primary focus is safeguarding web applications, our solution is intricately linked to the concept of \"virtual hosts\" or \"vhosts\" (more info here). These virtual hosts enable the serving of multiple web applications from a single instance or cluster.</p> <p>By default, BunkerWeb has the multisite mode disabled. This means that only one web application will be served, and all settings will be applied to it. This setup is ideal when you have a single application to protect, as you don't need to concern yourself with multisite configurations.</p> <p>However, when the multisite mode is enabled, BunkerWeb becomes capable of serving and protecting multiple web applications. Each web application is identified by a unique server name and has its own set of settings. This mode proves beneficial when you have multiple applications to secure, and you prefer to utilize a single instance (or a cluster) of BunkerWeb.</p> <p>The activation of the multisite mode is controlled by the <code>MULTISITE</code> setting, which can be set to <code>yes</code> to enable it or <code>no</code> to keep it disabled (which is the default value).</p> <p>Each setting within BunkerWeb has a specific context that determines where it can be applied. If the context is set to \"global,\" the setting can't be applied per server or site but is instead applied to the entire configuration as a whole. On the other hand, if the context is \"multisite,\" the setting can be applied globally and per server. To define a multisite setting for a specific server, simply add the server name as a prefix to the setting name. For example, <code>app1.example.com_AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT</code> or <code>app2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT</code> are examples of setting names with server name prefixes. When a multisite setting is defined globally without a server prefix, all servers inherit that setting. However, individual servers can still override the setting if the same setting is defined with a server name prefix.</p> <p>Understanding the intricacies of multisite mode and its associated settings allows you to tailor BunkerWeb's behavior to suit your specific requirements, ensuring optimal protection for your web applications.</p> <p>Here's a dummy example of a multisite BunkerWeb configuration :</p> <pre><code>MULTISITE=yes\nSERVER_NAME=app1.example.com app2.example.com app3.example.com\nAUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT=yes\nUSE_GZIP=yes\nUSE_BROTLI=yes\napp1.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=javascript\napp1.example.com_USE_MODSECURITY=no\napp2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=cookie\napp2.example.com_WHITELIST_COUNTRY=FR\napp3.example.com_USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR=no\n</code></pre> <p>Going further</p> <p>You will find concrete examples of multisite mode in the quickstart guide of the documentation and the examples directory of the repository.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#custom-configurations","title":"Custom configurations","text":"<p>To address unique challenges and cater to specific use cases, BunkerWeb offers the flexibility of custom configurations.

These prebuilt images are optimized and prepared for use on the following architectures:</p> <ul> <li>x64 (64-bit)</li> <li>x86</li> <li>armv8 (ARM 64-bit)</li> <li>armv7 (ARM 32-bit)</li> </ul> <p>By accessing these prebuilt images from Docker Hub, you can quickly pull and run BunkerWeb within your Docker environment, eliminating the need for extensive configuration or setup processes. This streamlined approach allows you to focus on leveraging the capabilities of BunkerWeb without unnecessary complexities.</p> <p>Whether you're conducting tests, developing applications, or deploying BunkerWeb in production, the Docker containerization option provides flexibility and ease of use.

Please read the Docker autoconf integration section first if needed.</p> <p>To enable automatic configuration of BunkerWeb instances, the autoconf service requires access to the Docker API. This service listens for Docker Swarm events, such as service creation or deletion, and seamlessly configures the BunkerWeb instances in real-time without any downtime. It also monitors other Swarm objects, such as configs, for custom configurations.</p> <p>Similar to the Docker autoconf integration, configuration for web services is defined using labels that start with the bunkerweb  prefix.</p> <p>For an optimal setup, it is recommended to schedule the BunkerWeb service as a global service on all nodes, while the autoconf, scheduler, and Docker API proxy services should be scheduled as single replicated services. Please note that the Docker API proxy service needs to be scheduled on a manager node unless you configure it to use a remote API (which is not covered in the documentation).</p> <p>Since multiple instances of BunkerWeb are running, a shared data store implemented as a Redis service must be created. These instances will utilize the Redis service to cache and share data. Further details regarding the Redis settings can be found here.</p> <p>As for the database volume, the documentation does not specify a specific approach.

Even when BunkerWeb is positioned behind a Load Balancer, the settings remain the same (with PROXY protocol being the supported option due to evident reasons).</p> <p>On top of that, the following specific settings are used :</p> <ul> <li><code>SERVER_TYPE=stream</code> : activate <code>stream</code> mode (generic UDP/TCP) instead of <code>http</code> one (which is the default)</li> <li><code>LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=4242</code> : the listening \"plain\" (without SSL/TLS) port that BunkerWeb will listen on</li> <li><code>LISTEN_STREAM_PORT_SSL=4343</code> : the listening \"ssl/tls\" port that BunkerWeb will listen on</li> <li><code>USE_UDP=no</code> : listen for and forward UDP packets instead of TCP</li> </ul> <p>For complete list of settings regarding <code>stream</code> mode, please refer to the settings section of the documentation.</p> <p>Testing</p> <p>To perform quick tests when stream mode is enabled you can use nc (netcat) :</p> <pre><code>nc -v -z -w 3 app1.example.com 10000\n</code></pre> DockerDocker autoconfSwarmKubernetesLinux <p>When using Docker integration, the easiest way of protecting existing network applications is to add the services in the <code>bw-services</code> network :</p> <pre><code>x-bw-api-env: &amp;bw-api-env\n  # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for all services\n  API_WHITELIST_IP: \"127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24\"\n\nservices:\n  bunkerweb:\n    image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:1.6.0-beta\n    ports:\n      -

We highly recommend you to follow minimal security best practices like :</p> <ul> <li>Choose a strong password for the login (at least 8 chars with 1 lower case letter, 1 upper case letter, 1 digit and 1 special char is required)</li> <li>Put the web UI under a \"hard to guess\" URI</li> <li>Do not open the web UI on the Internet without any further restrictions</li> <li>Apply settings listed in the security tuning section of the documentation</li> </ul> <p>Please note that using HTTPS in front the web UI is mandatory since version 1.5.8 of BunkerWeb.</p> <p>Multisite mode</p> <p>The usage of the web UI implies enabling the multisite mode.</p> <p>web UI specific environment variables</p> <p>The web UI uses the following environment variables :</p> <ul> <li><code>OVERRIDE_ADMIN_CREDS</code> : set it to <code>yes</code> to enable the override even if the admin credentials are already set (default is <code>no</code>).</li> <li><code>ADMIN_USERNAME</code> : username to access the web UI.</li> <li><code>ADMIN_PASSWORD</code> : password to access the web UI.</li> <li><code>FLASK_SECRET</code> : a secret key used to encrypt the session cookie (if not set, a random key will be generated).</li> <li><code>TOTP_SECRETS</code> : a list of TOTP secrets separated by spaces or a dictionary (e.g. : <code>{\"1\": \"mysecretkey\"}</code> or <code>mysecretkey</code> or <code>mysecretkey mysecretkey1</code>). We strongly recommend you to set this variable if you want to use 2FA, as it will be used to encrypt the TOTP secret keys (if not set, a random number of secret keys will be generated).

If you want to start the web UI when on startup you can run the following command :</p> <pre><code>systemctl enable bunkerweb-ui\n</code></pre> <p>A dedicated environment file located at <code>/etc/bunkerweb/ui.env</code> is used to configure the web UI :</p> <pre><code>ADMIN_USERNAME=changeme\nADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme\nTOTP_SECRETS=mysecret\n</code></pre> <p>Replace the <code>changeme</code> data with your own values.</p> <p>Remember to set a stronger secret key for the <code>TOTP_SECRETS</code> variable, check the Prerequisites section for more information.</p> <p>Each time you edit the <code>/etc/bunkerweb/ui.env</code> file, you will need to restart the service :</p> <pre><code>systemctl restart bunkerweb-ui\n</code></pre> <p>Accessing the web UI through BunkerWeb is a classical reverse proxy setup. Please note that the web UI is listening on the <code>7000</code> port and only on the loopback interface.</p> <p>Here is the <code>/etc/bunkerweb/variables.env</code> boilerplate you can use :</p> <pre><code>HTTP_PORT=80\nHTTPS_PORT=443\nDNS_RESOLVERS=9.9.9.9 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\nAPI_LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1\nSERVER_NAME=www.example.com\nMULTISITE=yes\nwww.example.com_USE_UI=yes\nwww.example.com_USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes\nwww.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/changeme\nwww.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:7000\nwww.example.com_INTERCEPTED_ERROR_CODES=400 404 405 413 429 500 501 502 503 504\nwww.example.com_GENERATE_SELF_SIGNED_SSL=yes\nwww.example.com_MAX_CLIENT_SIZE=50m\nwww.example.com_ALLOWED_METHODS=GET|POST|PUT|DELETE\n</code></pre> <p>Don't forget to reload the <code>bunkerweb</code> service :</p> <pre><code>systemctl reload bunkerweb\n</code></pre>"}]}
