You will also need to expose the stream ports.</p> <p>This example configures BunkerWeb to proxy two stream-based applications, <code>app1.example.com</code> and <code>app2.example.com</code>.</p> <pre><code>docker run -d \\\n    --name bunkerweb-aio \\\n    -v bw-storage:/data \\\n    -e SERVICE_UI=\"no\" \\\n    -e SERVER_NAME=\"app1.example.com app2.example.com\" \\\n    -e MULTISITE=\"yes\" \\\n    -e USE_REVERSE_PROXY=\"yes\" \\\n    -e SERVER_TYPE=\"stream\" \\\n    -e app1.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=\"myapp1:9000\" \\\n    -e app1.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=\"10000\" \\\n    -e app2.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=\"myapp2:9000\" \\\n    -e app2.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=\"20000\" \\\n    -p 80:8080/tcp \\\n    -p 443:8443/tcp \\\n    -p 443:8443/udp \\\n    -p 10000:10000/tcp \\\n    -p 20000:20000/tcp \\\n    bunkerity/bunkerweb-all-in-one:testing\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that if your container is already created, you will need to delete it and recreate it for the new environment variables to be applied.</p> <p>Your applications (<code>myapp1</code>, <code>myapp2</code>) should be running in separate containers (or be otherwise accessible) and their hostnames/IPs (e.g., <code>myapp1</code>, <code>myapp2</code> used in <code>_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST</code>) must be resolvable and reachable from the <code>bunkerweb-aio</code> container. This typically involves connecting them to a shared Docker network.</p> <p>Deactivate UI Service</p> <p>Deactivating the UI service (e.g., by setting <code>SERVICE_UI=no</code> as an environment variable) is recommended as the Web UI is not compatible with <code>SERVER_TYPE=stream</code>.</p> <p>When using Docker integration, the easiest way of protecting existing network applications is to add the services in the <code>bw-services</code> network :</p> <pre><code>x-bw-api-env: &amp;bw-api-env\n  # We use an anchor to avoid repeating the same settings for all services\n  API_WHITELIST_IP: \"127.0.0.0/8 10.20.30.0/24\"\n  # Optional API token for authenticated API calls\n  API_TOKEN: \"\"\n\nservices:\n  bunkerweb:\n    image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:testing\n    ports:\n      - \"80:8080\" # Keep it if you want to use Let's Encrypt automation when using http challenge type\n      - \"10000:10000\" # app1\n      - \"20000:20000\" # app2\n    labels:\n      - \"bunkerweb.INSTANCE=yes\"\n    environment:\n      &lt;&lt;: *bw-api-env\n    restart: \"unless-stopped\"\n    networks:\n      - bw-universe\n      - bw-services\n\n  bw-scheduler:\n    image: bunkerity/bunkerweb-scheduler:testing\n    environment:\n      &lt;&lt;: *bw-api-env\n      BUNKERWEB_INSTANCES: \"bunkerweb\" # This setting is mandatory to specify the BunkerWeb instance\n      SERVER_NAME: \"app1.example.com app2.example.com\"\n      MULTISITE: \"yes\"\n      USE_REVERSE_PROXY: \"yes\" # Will be applied to all services\n      SERVER_TYPE: \"stream\" # Will be applied to all services\n      app1.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST: \"myapp1:9000\"\n      app1.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT: \"10000\"\n      app2.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST: \"myapp2:9000\"\n      app2.example.com_LISTEN_STREAM_PORT: \"20000\"\n    volumes:\n      - bw-storage:/data # This is used to persist the cache and other data like the backups\n    restart: \"unless-stopped\"\n    networks:\n      - bw-universe\n\n  myapp1:\n    image: istio/tcp-echo-server:1.3\n    command: [ \"9000\", \"app1\" ]\n    networks:\n      - bw-services\n\n  myapp2:\n    image: istio/tcp-echo-server:1.3\n    command: [ \"9000\", \"app2\" ]\n    networks:\n      - bw-services\n\nvolumes:\n  bw-storage:\n\nnetworks:\n  bw-universe:\n    name: bw-universe\n    ipam:\n      driver: default\n      config:\n        - subnet: 10.20.30.0/24\n  bw-services:\n    name: bw-services\n</code></pre> <p>Before running the Docker autoconf integration stack on your machine, you will need to edit the ports :</p> <pre><code>services:\n  bunkerweb:\n    image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:testing\n    ports:\n      - \"80:8080\" # Keep it if you want to use Let's Encrypt automation when using http challenge type\n      - \"10000:10000\" # app1\n      - \"20000:20000\" # app2\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Once the stack is running, you can connect your existing applications to the <code>bw-services</code> network and configure BunkerWeb with labels :</p> <pre><code>services:\n  myapp1:\n    image: istio/tcp-echo-server:1.3\n    command: [ \"9000\", \"app1\" ]\n    networks:\n      - bw-services\n    labels:\n      - \"bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=app1.example.com\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.SERVER_TYPE=stream\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=myapp1:9000\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=10000\"\n\n  myapp2:\n    image: istio/tcp-echo-server:1.3\n    command: [ \"9000\", \"app2\" ]\n    networks:\n      - bw-services\n    labels:\n      - \"bunkerweb.SERVER_NAME=app2.example.com\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.SERVER_TYPE=stream\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=myapp2:9000\"\n      - \"bunkerweb.LISTEN_STREAM_PORT=20000\"\n\nnetworks:\n  bw-services:\n    external: true\n    name: bw-services\n</code></pre> <p>Experimental feature</p> <p>At the moment, Ingresses does not support the <code>stream</code> mode.

As our primary focus is safeguarding web applications, our solution is intricately linked to the concept of \"virtual hosts\" or \"vhosts\" (more info here). These virtual hosts enable the serving of multiple web applications from a single instance or cluster.</p> <p>By default, BunkerWeb has the multisite mode disabled. This means that only one web application will be served, and all settings will be applied to it. This setup is ideal when you have a single application to protect, as you don't need to concern yourself with multisite configurations.</p> <p>However, when the multisite mode is enabled, BunkerWeb becomes capable of serving and protecting multiple web applications. Each web application is identified by a unique server name and has its own set of settings. This mode proves beneficial when you have multiple applications to secure, and you prefer to utilize a single instance (or a cluster) of BunkerWeb.</p> <p>The activation of the multisite mode is controlled by the <code>MULTISITE</code> setting, which can be set to <code>yes</code> to enable it or <code>no</code> to keep it disabled (the default value).</p> <p>Each setting within BunkerWeb has a specific context that determines where it can be applied. If the context is set to \"global,\" the setting can't be applied per server or site but is instead applied to the entire configuration as a whole. On the other hand, if the context is \"multisite,\" the setting can be applied globally and per server. To define a multisite setting for a specific server, simply add the server name as a prefix to the setting name. For example, <code>app1.example.com_AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT</code> or <code>app2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT</code> are examples of setting names with server name prefixes. When a multisite setting is defined globally without a server prefix, all servers inherit that setting. However, individual servers can still override the setting if the same setting is defined with a server name prefix.</p> <p>Understanding the intricacies of multisite mode and its associated settings allows you to tailor BunkerWeb's behavior to suit your specific requirements, ensuring optimal protection for your web applications.</p> <p>Here's a dummy example of a multisite BunkerWeb configuration:</p> <pre><code>MULTISITE=yes\nSERVER_NAME=app1.example.com app2.example.com app3.example.com\nAUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT=yes\nUSE_GZIP=yes\nUSE_BROTLI=yes\napp1.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=javascript\napp1.example.com_USE_MODSECURITY=no\napp2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=cookie\napp2.example.com_WHITELIST_COUNTRY=FR\napp3.example.com_USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR=no\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that multisite mode is implicit when using the web User Interface.

Test thoroughly before enabling in production environments.</p> <p>HTTP Status Control</p> <p>The first step in handling denied client access is defining the appropriate action. This can be configured using the <code>DENY_HTTP_STATUS</code> setting. When BunkerWeb denies a request, you can control its response using this setting. By default, it returns a <code>403 Forbidden</code> status, displaying a web page or custom content to the client.</p> <p>Alternatively, setting it to <code>444</code> closes the connection immediately without sending any response. This non-standard status code, specific to NGINX, is useful for silently dropping unwanted requests.</p> Setting Default Context Multiple Description <code>DENY_HTTP_STATUS</code> <code>403</code> global no Deny HTTP Status: HTTP status code to send when request is denied (403 or 444). Code 444 closes the connection. <p>444 Status Code considerations</p> <p>Since clients receive no feedback, troubleshooting can be more challenging. Setting <code>444</code> is recommended only if you have thoroughly addressed false positives, are experienced with BunkerWeb, and require a higher level of security.</p> <p>Stream mode</p> <p>In stream mode, this setting is always enforced as <code>444</code>, meaning the connection will be closed, regardless of the configured value.</p> <p>HTTP Method Control</p> <p>Restricting HTTP methods to only those required by your application is a fundamental security measure that adheres to the principle of least privilege. By explicitly defining acceptable HTTP methods, you can minimize the risk of exploitation through unused or dangerous methods.</p> <p>This feature is configured using the <code>ALLOWED_METHODS</code> setting, where methods are listed and separated by a <code>|</code> (default: <code>GET|POST|HEAD</code>). If a client attempts to use a method not listed, the server will respond with a 405 - Method Not Allowed status.</p> <p>For most websites, the default <code>GET|POST|HEAD</code> is sufficient. If your application uses RESTful APIs, you may need to include methods like <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code>.</p> <p>Security Benefits</p> <ul> <li>Prevents exploitation of unused or unnecessary HTTP methods</li> <li>Reduces the attack surface by disabling potentially harmful methods</li> <li>Blocks HTTP method enumeration techniques used by attackers</li> </ul> Setting Default Context Multiple Description <code>ALLOWED_METHODS</code> <code>GET    | POST    | HEAD</code> multisite no HTTP Methods: List of HTTP methods that are allowed, separated by pipe characters. <p>CORS and Pre-flight Requests</p> <p>If your application supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), you should include the <code>OPTIONS</code> method in the <code>ALLOWED_METHODS</code> setting to handle pre-flight requests.

However, this is not recommended due to potential security and performance risks.</p> <p>Best Practices:</p> <ul> <li>Always configure <code>MAX_CLIENT_SIZE</code> to the smallest value that meets your application's legitimate requirements.</li> <li>Regularly review and adjust this setting to align with your application's evolving needs.</li> <li>Avoid setting <code>0</code> unless absolutely necessary, as it can expose your server to denial-of-service attacks and resource exhaustion.</li> </ul> <p>By carefully managing this setting, you can ensure optimal security and performance for your application.</p> <p>HTTP Protocol Settings</p> <p>Modern HTTP protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 improve performance and security. BunkerWeb allows easy configuration of these protocols.</p> <p>Security and Performance Benefits</p> <ul> <li>Security Advantages: Modern protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 enforce TLS/HTTPS by default, reduce susceptibility to certain attacks, and improve privacy through encrypted headers (HTTP/3).</li> <li>Performance Benefits: Features like multiplexing, header compression, server push, and binary data transfer enhance speed and efficiency.</li> </ul> Setting Default Context Multiple Description <code>LISTEN_HTTP</code> <code>yes</code> multisite no HTTP Listen: Respond to (insecure) HTTP requests when set to <code>yes</code>. <code>HTTP2</code> <code>yes</code> multisite no HTTP2: Support HTTP2 protocol when HTTPS is enabled. <code>HTTP3</code> <code>yes</code> multisite no HTTP3: Support HTTP3 protocol when HTTPS is enabled. <code>HTTP3_ALT_SVC_PORT</code> <code>443</code> multisite no HTTP3 Alt-Svc Port: Port to use in the Alt-Svc header for HTTP3. <p>About HTTP/3</p> <p>HTTP/3, the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, uses QUIC over UDP instead of TCP, addressing issues like head-of-line blocking for faster, more reliable connections.</p> <p>NGINX introduced experimental support for HTTP/3 and QUIC starting with version 1.25.0.

Please consider using the Kubernetes integration instead.</p> <p>PRO support</p> <p>If you need Swarm support, please contact us at contact@bunkerity.com or via the contact form.</p> <p>Docker autoconf</p> <p>The Swarm integration is similar to the Docker autoconf one (but with services instead of containers). Please read the Docker autoconf integration section first if needed.</p> <p>To enable automatic configuration of BunkerWeb instances, the autoconf service requires access to the Docker API. This service listens for Docker Swarm events, such as service creation or deletion, and seamlessly configures the BunkerWeb instances in real-time without any downtime. It also monitors other Swarm objects, such as configs, for custom configurations.</p> <p>Similar to the Docker autoconf integration, configuration for web services is defined using labels that start with the bunkerweb  prefix.</p> <p>For an optimal setup, it is recommended to schedule the BunkerWeb service as a global service on all nodes, while the autoconf, scheduler, and Docker API proxy services should be scheduled as single replicated services. Please note that the Docker API proxy service needs to be scheduled on a manager node unless you configure it to use a remote API (which is not covered in the documentation).</p> <p>Since multiple instances of BunkerWeb are running, a shared data store implemented as a Redis or Valkey service must be created. These instances will utilize the Redis/Valkey service to cache and share data. Further details regarding the Redis/Valkey settings can be found here.</p> <p>As for the database volume, the documentation does not specify a specific approach. Choosing either a shared folder or a specific driver for the database volume is dependent on your unique use-case and is left as an exercise for the reader.</p> <p>Database backend</p> <p>Please be aware that our instructions assume you are using MariaDB as the default database backend, as configured by the <code>DATABASE_URI</code> setting.

Each hook is associated with a specific phase.</p> before_requestafter_requestteardown_requestcontext_processor <p>These hooks are executed before processing an incoming request. They are typically used for pre-processing tasks such as authentication, validation, or logging.</p> <p>If the hook returns a response object, Flask will skip the request handling and return the response directly. This can be useful for short-circuiting the request processing pipeline.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>from flask import request, Response\n\ndef before_request():\n    print(\"Before-request: Validating request...\", flush=True)\n    # Perform authentication, validation, or logging here\n    if not is_valid_request(request): # We are in the app context\n        return Response(\"Invalid request!\", status=400)\n\ndef is_valid_request(request):\n    # Dummy validation logic\n    return \"user\" in request\n</code></pre> <p>These hooks that run after the request has been processed. They are ideal for post-processing tasks such as cleanup, additional logging, or modifying the response before it is sent back.</p> <p>They receive the response object as an argument and can modify it before returning it. The first after_request hook to return a response will be used as the final response.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>from flask import request\n\ndef after_request(response):\n    print(\"After-request: Logging response...\", flush=True)\n    # Perform logging, cleanup, or response modifications here\n    log_response(response)\n    return response\n\ndef log_response(response):\n    # Dummy logging logic\n    print(\"Response logged:\", response, flush=True)\n</code></pre> <p>These hooks are invoked when the request context is being torn down. These hooks are used for releasing resources or handling errors that occurred during the request lifecycle.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>def teardown_request(error=None):\n    print(\"Teardown-request: Cleaning up resources...\", flush=True)\n    # Perform cleanup, release resources, or handle errors here\n    if error:\n        handle_error(error)\n    cleanup_resources()\n\ndef handle_error(error):\n    # Dummy error handling logic\n    print(\"Error encountered:\", error, flush=True)\n\ndef cleanup_resources():\n    # Dummy resource cleanup logic\n    print(\"Resources have been cleaned up.\", flush=True)\n</code></pre> <p>These hooks are used to inject additional context into templates or views. They enrich the runtime context by passing common data (like user information or configuration settings) to the templates.</p> <p>If a context processor returns a dictionary, the keys and values will be added to the context for all templates. This allows you to share data across multiple views or templates.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>def context_processor() -&gt; dict:\n    print(\"Context-processor: Injecting context data...\", flush=True)\n    # Return a dictionary containing context data for templates/views\n    return {\n        \"current_user\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"app_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n        \"feature_flags\": {\"new_ui\": True}\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>This lifecycle hook design provides a modular and systematic approach to managing various aspects of a request's lifecycle:</p> <ul> <li>Modularity: Each hook is responsible for a distinct phase, ensuring that concerns are separated.</li> <li>Maintainability: Developers can easily add, modify, or remove hook implementations without impacting other parts of the request lifecycle.</li> <li>Extensibility: The framework is flexible, allowing for additional hooks or enhancements as application requirements evolve.</li> </ul> <p>By clearly defining the responsibilities of each hook and their associated logging prefixes, the system ensures that each stage of request processing is transparent and manageable.</p>"},{"location":"plugins/#blueprints","title":"Blueprints","text":"<p>In Flask, blueprints serve as a modular way to organize related components\u2014such as views, templates, and static files\u2014within your application.

You would add or modify the following environment variables in your <code>docker run</code> command:</p> <pre><code># First, stop and remove the existing container if it's running:\n# docker stop bunkerweb-aio\n# docker rm bunkerweb-aio\n\n# Then, re-run the bunkerweb-aio container with additional/updated environment variables:\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name bunkerweb-aio \\\n  -v bw-storage:/data \\\n  -p 80:8080/tcp \\\n  -p 443:8443/tcp \\\n  -p 443:8443/udp \\\n  # --- Add/modify these environment variables for your new service ---\n  -e MULTISITE=yes \\\n  -e SERVER_NAME=\"www.example.com\" \\\n  -e \"www.example.com_USE_REVERSE_PROXY=yes\" \\\n  -e \"www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_HOST=http://myapp:8080\" \\\n  -e \"www.example.com_REVERSE_PROXY_URL=/\" \\\n  # --- Include any other existing environment variables for UI, Redis, CrowdSec, etc. ---\n  bunkerity/bunkerweb-all-in-one:testing\n</code></pre> <p>Your application container (<code>myapp</code>) and the <code>bunkerweb-aio</code> container must be on the same Docker network for BunkerWeb to reach it using the hostname <code>myapp</code>.</p> <p>Network Setup Example: <pre><code># 1.

This update specifically impacts container-based integrations: the web UI will now read the log files from the <code>/var/log/bunkerweb</code> directory.</p> <p>To keep the logs accessible from the web UI, we recommend that you use a syslog server, such as <code>syslog-ng</code>, to read the logs and create the corresponding files in the <code>/var/log/bunkerweb</code> directory.</p> <p>Using local folder for logs</p> <p>The web UI runs as an unprivileged user with UID 101 and GID 101 inside the container for security reasons: in case a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker won't have full root (UID/GID 0) privileges.</p> <p>However, there is a downside: if you use a local folder for logs, you must set the correct permissions so that the unprivileged user can read the log files. For example:</p> <pre><code>mkdir bw-logs &amp;&amp; \\\nchown root:101 bw-logs &amp;&amp; \\\nchmod 770 bw-logs\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, if the folder already exists:</p> <pre><code>chown -R root:101 bw-logs &amp;&amp; \\\nchmod -R 770 bw-logs\n</code></pre> <p>If you are using Docker in rootless mode or podman, UIDs and GIDs in the container will be mapped to different ones in the host.

Voici un exemple qui conserve jusqu'\u00e0 10 fichiers journaux de 20 Mo chacun :</p> <pre><code>services:\n  bunkerweb:\n    image: bunkerity/bunkerweb:testing\n    logging:\n      driver: \"json-file\"\n      options:\n        max-size: \"20m\"\n        max-file: \"10\"\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>Cette configuration garantit la rotation des journaux, les emp\u00eachant de remplir votre disque. Vous pouvez l'appliquer \u00e0 n'importe quel service de votre configuration Docker Compose.</p> <p>Configuration globale (daemon.json)</p> <p>Si vous souhaitez appliquer ces param\u00e8tres de journalisation \u00e0 tous les conteneurs de l'h\u00f4te par d\u00e9faut, vous pouvez configurer le d\u00e9mon Docker en modifiant (ou en cr\u00e9ant) le fichier <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> :</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"log-driver\": \"json-file\",\n  \"log-opts\": {\n    \"max-size\": \"20m\",\n    \"max-file\": \"10\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Apr\u00e8s avoir modifi\u00e9 <code>daemon.json</code>, vous devez red\u00e9marrer le d\u00e9mon Docker pour que les modifications prennent effet :</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl restart docker\n</code></pre> <p>Cette configuration globale sera h\u00e9rit\u00e9e par tous les conteneurs.

Ces h\u00f4tes virtuels permettent de diffuser plusieurs applications Web \u00e0 partir d'une seule instance ou d'un seul cluster.</p> <p>Par d\u00e9faut, le mode multisite est d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9 sur BunkerWeb.

Cette configuration est id\u00e9ale lorsque vous avez une seule application \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger, car vous n'avez pas besoin de vous soucier des configurations multisites.</p> <p>Cependant, lorsque le mode multisite est activ\u00e9, BunkerWeb devient capable de servir et de prot\u00e9ger plusieurs applications Web. Chaque application Web est identifi\u00e9e par un nom de serveur unique et poss\u00e8de son propre ensemble de param\u00e8tres.

Pour d\u00e9finir un param\u00e8tre multisite pour un serveur sp\u00e9cifique, il suffit d'ajouter le nom du serveur en tant que pr\u00e9fixe au nom du param\u00e8tre. Par exemple, <code>app1.example.com_AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT</code> ou <code>app2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT</code> sont des exemples de d\u00e9finition de noms avec des pr\u00e9fixes de nom de serveur. Lorsqu'un param\u00e8tre multisite est d\u00e9fini globalement sans pr\u00e9fixe de serveur, tous les serveurs h\u00e9ritent de ce param\u00e8tre.

Um eine Multisite-Einstellung f\u00fcr einen bestimmten Server zu definieren, f\u00fcgen Sie einfach den Servernamen als Pr\u00e4fix zum Einstellungsnamen hinzu. Zum Beispiel sind <code>app1.example.com_AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT</code> oder <code>app2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT</code> Beispiele f\u00fcr Einstellungsnamen mit Servernamenpr\u00e4fixen.

Esta configuraci\u00f3n es ideal cuando tienes una sola aplicaci\u00f3n que proteger, ya que no necesitas preocuparte por las configuraciones multisitio.</p> <p>Sin embargo, cuando el modo multisitio est\u00e1 habilitado, BunkerWeb se vuelve capaz de servir y proteger m\u00faltiples aplicaciones web. Cada aplicaci\u00f3n web se identifica por un nombre de servidor \u00fanico y tiene su propio conjunto de configuraciones. Este modo resulta beneficioso cuando tienes m\u00faltiples aplicaciones que asegurar y prefieres utilizar una \u00fanica instancia (o un cl\u00faster) de BunkerWeb.</p> <p>La activaci\u00f3n del modo multisitio se controla mediante la configuraci\u00f3n <code>MULTISITE</code>, que se puede establecer en <code>yes</code> para habilitarlo o <code>no</code> para mantenerlo deshabilitado (el valor predeterminado).</p> <p>Cada configuraci\u00f3n dentro de BunkerWeb tiene un contexto espec\u00edfico que determina d\u00f3nde se puede aplicar. Si el contexto se establece en \"global\", la configuraci\u00f3n no se puede aplicar por servidor o sitio, sino que se aplica a toda la configuraci\u00f3n en su conjunto. Por otro lado, si el contexto es \"multisitio\", la configuraci\u00f3n se puede aplicar globalmente y por servidor. Para definir una configuraci\u00f3n multisitio para un servidor espec\u00edfico, simplemente agrega el nombre del servidor como prefijo al nombre de la configuraci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo, <code>app1.example.com_AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT</code> o <code>app2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT</code> son ejemplos de nombres de configuraci\u00f3n con prefijos de nombre de servidor. Cuando una configuraci\u00f3n multisitio se define globalmente sin un prefijo de servidor, todos los servidores heredan esa configuraci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, los servidores individuales a\u00fan pueden anular la configuraci\u00f3n si la misma configuraci\u00f3n se define con un prefijo de nombre de servidor.</p> <p>Comprender las complejidades del modo multisitio y sus configuraciones asociadas te permite adaptar el comportamiento de BunkerWeb a tus requisitos espec\u00edficos, garantizando una protecci\u00f3n \u00f3ptima para tus aplicaciones web.</p> <p>Aqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo ficticio de una configuraci\u00f3n multisitio de BunkerWeb:</p> <pre><code>MULTISITE=yes\nSERVER_NAME=app1.example.com app2.example.com app3.example.com\nAUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT=yes\nUSE_GZIP=yes\nUSE_BROTLI=yes\napp1.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=javascript\napp1.example.com_USE_MODSECURITY=no\napp2.example.com_USE_ANTIBOT=cookie\napp2.example.com_WHITELIST_COUNTRY=FR\napp3.example.com_USE_BAD_BEHAVIOR=no\n</code></pre> <p>Ten en cuenta que el modo multisitio es impl\u00edcito cuando se utiliza la interfaz de usuario web.

Este servicio escucha los eventos de Docker Swarm, como la creaci\u00f3n o eliminaci\u00f3n de servicios, y configura sin problemas las instancias de BunkerWeb en tiempo real sin ning\u00fan tiempo de inactividad.

Ten en cuenta que el servicio de proxy de la API de Docker debe programarse en un nodo gestor, a menos que lo configures para usar una API remota (lo que no se cubre en la documentaci\u00f3n).</p> <p>Dado que se est\u00e1n ejecutando m\u00faltiples instancias de BunkerWeb, se debe crear un almac\u00e9n de datos compartido implementado como un servicio de Redis o Valkey. Estas instancias utilizar\u00e1n el servicio Redis/Valkey para almacenar en cach\u00e9 y compartir datos. Se pueden encontrar m\u00e1s detalles sobre la configuraci\u00f3n de Redis/Valkey aqu\u00ed.</p> <p>En cuanto al volumen de la base de datos, la documentaci\u00f3n no especifica un enfoque concreto. La elecci\u00f3n de una carpeta compartida o un controlador espec\u00edfico para el volumen de la base de datos depende de tu caso de uso particular y se deja como ejercicio para el lector.</p> <p>Backend de la base de datos</p> <p>Ten en cuenta que nuestras instrucciones asumen que est\u00e1s utilizando MariaDB como el backend de base de datos predeterminado, seg\u00fan lo configurado por el ajuste <code>DATABASE_URI</code>. Sin embargo, entendemos que puedes preferir utilizar backends alternativos para tu integraci\u00f3n con Docker.

Aqu\u00ed tienes un ejemplo:</p> <pre><code>services:\n  myapp:\n    image: mywebapp:4.2\n    networks:\n      - bw-services\n    deploy:\n      placement:\n        constraints:\n          - \"node.role==worker\"\n      labels:\n        - \"bunkerweb.NAMESPACE=my-namespace\" # Establece el espacio de nombres para el servicio\n        - \"bunkerweb.MY_SETTING_1=value1\"\n        - \"bunkerweb.MY_SETTING_2=value2\"\n\nnetworks:\n  bw-services:\n    external: true\n    name: bw-services\n</code></pre> <p>Comportamiento del espacio de nombres</p> <p>Por defecto, todas las pilas de Autoconfiguraci\u00f3n escuchan a todos los espacios de nombres.

Cada gancho est\u00e1 asociado a una fase espec\u00edfica.\n\n=== \"before_request\"\n    Estos ganchos se ejecutan **antes** de procesar una solicitud entrante. Se utilizan normalmente para tareas de preprocesamiento como autenticaci\u00f3n, validaci\u00f3n o registro.\n\n    Si el gancho devuelve un objeto de respuesta, Flask omitir\u00e1 el manejo de la solicitud y devolver\u00e1 la respuesta directamente. Esto puede ser \u00fatil para cortocircuitar el pipeline de procesamiento de la solicitud.\n\n    **Ejemplo:**\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import request, Response\n\n    def before_request():\n        print(\"Antes de la solicitud: validando la solicitud...\", flush=True)\n        # Realizar autenticaci\u00f3n, validaci\u00f3n o registro aqu\u00ed\n        if not is_valid_request(request): # Estamos en el contexto de la aplicaci\u00f3n\n            return Response(\"\u00a1Solicitud inv\u00e1lida!\", status=400)\n\n    def is_valid_request(request):\n        # L\u00f3gica de validaci\u00f3n ficticia\n        return \"user\" in request\n    ```\n=== \"after_request\"\n    Estos ganchos se ejecutan **despu\u00e9s** de que la solicitud ha sido procesada. Son ideales para tareas de postprocesamiento como limpieza, registro adicional o modificaci\u00f3n de la respuesta antes de que se env\u00ede de vuelta.\n\n    Reciben el objeto de respuesta como argumento y pueden modificarlo antes de devolverlo. El primer gancho after_request que devuelva una respuesta se utilizar\u00e1 como la respuesta final.\n\n    **Ejemplo:**\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import request\n\n    def after_request(response):\n        print(\"Despu\u00e9s de la solicitud: registrando la respuesta...\", flush=True)\n        # Realizar registro, limpieza o modificaciones de la respuesta aqu\u00ed\n        log_response(response)\n        return response\n\n    def log_response(response):\n        # L\u00f3gica de registro ficticia\n        print(\"Respuesta registrada:\", response, flush=True)\n    ```\n=== \"teardown_request\"\n    Estos ganchos se invocan cuando el contexto de la solicitud se est\u00e1 desmontando. Estos ganchos se utilizan para liberar recursos o manejar errores que ocurrieron durante el ciclo de vida de la solicitud.\n\n    **Ejemplo:**\n\n    ```python\n    def teardown_request(error=None):\n        print(\"Desmontaje de la solicitud: limpiando recursos...\", flush=True)\n        # Realizar limpieza, liberar recursos o manejar errores aqu\u00ed\n        if error:\n            handle_error(error)\n        cleanup_resources()\n\n    def handle_error(error):\n        # L\u00f3gica de manejo de errores ficticia\n        print(\"Error encontrado:\", error, flush=True)\n\n    def cleanup_resources():\n        # L\u00f3gica de limpieza de recursos ficticia\n        print(\"Los recursos han sido limpiados.\", flush=True)\n    ```\n=== \"context_processor\"\n    Estos ganchos se utilizan para inyectar contexto adicional en las plantillas o vistas. Enriquecen el contexto de tiempo de ejecuci\u00f3n pasando datos comunes (como informaci\u00f3n del usuario o configuraciones) a las plantillas.\n\n    Si un procesador de contexto devuelve un diccionario, las claves y los valores se a\u00f1adir\u00e1n al contexto para todas las plantillas. Esto te permite compartir datos entre m\u00faltiples vistas o plantillas.\n\n    **Ejemplo:**\n\n    ```python\n    def context_processor() -&gt; dict:\n        print(\"Procesador de contexto: inyectando datos de contexto...\", flush=True)\n        # Devolver un diccionario que contenga datos de contexto para las plantillas/vistas\n        return {\n            \"current_user\": \"John Doe\",\n            \"app_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n            \"feature_flags\": {\"new_ui\": True}\n        }\n    ```\n\nEste dise\u00f1o de ganchos de ciclo de vida proporciona un enfoque modular y sistem\u00e1tico para gestionar diversos aspectos del ciclo de vida de una solicitud:\n\n- **Modularidad:** Cada gancho es responsable de una fase distinta, asegurando que las responsabilidades est\u00e9n separadas.\n- **Mantenibilidad:** Los desarrolladores pueden a\u00f1adir, modificar o eliminar f\u00e1cilmente implementaciones de ganchos sin afectar otras partes del ciclo de vida de la solicitud.\n- **Extensibilidad:** El marco es flexible, lo que permite a\u00f1adir ganchos adicionales o mejoras a medida que evolucionan los requisitos de la aplicaci\u00f3n.\n\nAl definir claramente las responsabilidades de cada gancho y sus prefijos de registro asociados, el sistema asegura que cada etapa del procesamiento de la solicitud sea transparente y manejable.\n\n### Blueprints\n\nEn Flask, los **blueprints** sirven como una forma modular de organizar componentes relacionados \u2014como vistas, plantillas y archivos est\u00e1ticos\u2014 dentro de tu aplicaci\u00f3n. Te permiten agrupar la funcionalidad de manera l\u00f3gica y se pueden usar para crear nuevas secciones de tu aplicaci\u00f3n o sobrescribir las existentes.\n\n#### Crear un Blueprint\n\nPara definir un blueprint, creas una instancia de la clase `Blueprint`, especificando su nombre y la ruta de importaci\u00f3n. Luego, defines las rutas y vistas asociadas a este blueprint.\n\n**Ejemplo: Definir un nuevo Blueprint**\n\n```python\nfrom os.path import dirname\nfrom flask import Blueprint, render_template\n\n# Definir el blueprint\nmi_blueprint = Blueprint('mi_blueprint', __name__, template_folder=dirname(__file__) + '/templates') # La carpeta de plantillas se establece para evitar conflictos con el blueprint original\n\n# Definir una ruta dentro del blueprint\n@mi_blueprint.route('/mi_blueprint')\ndef mi_pagina_blueprint():\n    return render_template('mi_blueprint.html')\n</code></pre></p> <p>En este ejemplo, se crea un blueprint llamado <code>mi_blueprint</code> y se define una ruta <code>/mi_blueprint</code> dentro de \u00e9l.</p>"},{"location":"es/plugins/#sobrescribir-un-blueprint-existente","title":"Sobrescribir un Blueprint existente","text":"<p>Los blueprints tambi\u00e9n pueden sobrescribir los existentes para modificar o ampliar la funcionalidad.
