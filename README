Lua-GD, the gd bindings for the Lua Programming Language

+ Introduction

"gd" is a C graphics library created by Thomas Boutell that allows your
code to quickly draw complete images with lines, polygons, arcs, text,
multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, flood fills, read in
or write out images in the PNG, JPEG or GIF format. This is particularly
useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG and JPEG are two of the
formats accepted for inline images by most browsers. gd does not provide
for every possible desirable graphics operation. It is not necessary or
desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics package, but it does
include most frequently requested features, including both truecolor
and palette images, resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images)
and so forth. You can get more information about gd from it's homepage.

Lua-GD is a "binding": a library that exports gd functions to the Lua
Programming Language, allowing you to use gd from Lua. The API was
NOT literally exported, but changed in a way that make it familiar to
Lua users.

Lua-GD is a programming library, not a paint program. If you are looking
for that or are not familiar to the Lua Programming Language, you are
in the wrong place.
